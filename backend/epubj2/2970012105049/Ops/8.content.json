He arose, af\u00ADter his in\u00ADtro\u00ADduc\u00ADtion, in a bath of cold per\u00ADspi\u00ADra\u00ADtion. The ap\u00ADplause gave him a mo\u00ADment to re\u00ADcov\u00ADer him\u00ADself, but not a word came to his mind. He sparred for time by some in\u00ADfor\u00ADmal pref\u00ADa\u00ADto\u00ADry re\u00ADmarks ex\u00ADpress\u00ADing re\u00ADgret at his ill\u00ADness and that he had been com\u00ADpelled to dis\u00ADap\u00ADpoint his au\u00ADdi\u00ADence a few days be\u00ADfore, and then he stood help\u00ADless! In sheer des\u00ADper\u00ADa\u00ADtion he looked at Mrs. Bok sit\u00ADting in the stage box, who, di\u00ADvin\u00ADing her hus\u00ADband's plight, mo\u00ADtioned to the in\u00ADside pock\u00ADet of his coat. He put his hand there and pulled out a copy of his lec\u00ADture which she had placed there! The whole trag\u00ADic com\u00ADe\u00ADdy had hap\u00ADpened so quick\u00ADly that the au\u00ADdi\u00ADence was ab\u00ADso\u00ADlute\u00ADly un\u00ADa\u00ADware of what had oc\u00ADcurred, and Bok went on and prac\u00ADti\u00ADcal\u00ADly read his lec\u00ADture. But it was not a suc\u00ADcess\u00ADful eve\u00ADning for his au\u00ADdi\u00ADence or for him\u00ADself, and the one was doubt\u00ADless as glad when it was over as the oth\u00ADer."
