Mr. Bush asked Ed\u00ADward to sug\u00ADgest a name for the new pe\u00ADri\u00ADod\u00ADi\u00ADcal, and in the fol\u00ADlow\u00ADing month of May, 1887, The Brook\u00ADlyn Mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine be\u00ADcame The Amer\u00ADi\u00ADcan Mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine, with its pub\u00ADli\u00ADca\u00ADtion of\u00ADfice in New York. But, though a great deal of mon\u00ADey was spent on the new mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine, it did not suc\u00ADceed. Mr. Bush sold his in\u00ADter\u00ADest in the pe\u00ADri\u00ADod\u00ADi\u00ADcal, which, once more chang\u00ADing its name, be\u00ADcame The Cos\u00ADmo\u00ADpol\u00ADi\u00ADtan Mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine. Since then it has passed through the hands of sev\u00ADer\u00ADal own\u00ADers, but the name has re\u00ADmained the same. Be\u00ADfore Mr. Bush sold The Amer\u00ADi\u00ADcan Mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine he had urged Ed\u00ADward to come back to it as its ed\u00ADi\u00ADtor, with prom\u00ADise of fi\u00ADnan\u00ADcial sup\u00ADport; but the young man felt in\u00ADstinc\u00ADtive\u00ADly that his re\u00ADturn would not be wise. The mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine had been The Cos\u00ADmo\u00ADpol\u00ADi\u00ADtan only a short time when the new own\u00ADers, Mr. Paul J. Slicht and Mr. E. D.

He had not heard the last of it, how\u00ADev\u00ADer, for, by a cu\u00ADri\u00ADous co\u00ADin\u00ADci\u00ADdence, its sub\u00ADse\u00ADquent own\u00ADer, en\u00ADtire\u00ADly ig\u00ADno\u00ADrant of Ed\u00ADward's pre\u00ADvi\u00ADous as\u00ADso\u00ADci\u00ADa\u00ADtion with the mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine, in\u00ADvit\u00ADed him to con\u00ADnect him\u00ADself with it. Thus three times could Ed\u00ADward Bok have re\u00ADturned to the mag\u00ADa\u00ADzine for whose cre\u00ADa\u00ADtion he was re\u00ADspon\u00ADsi\u00ADble."

He looked over the ground, and found that while his idea was not a new one, since two \"syn\u00ADdi\u00ADcate\" agencies al\u00ADready ex\u00ADisted, the field was by no means ful\u00ADly cov\u00ADered, and that the suc\u00ADcess of a third agen\u00ADcy would de\u00ADpend en\u00ADtire\u00ADly upon its abil\u00ADi\u00ADty to fur\u00ADnish the news\u00ADpa\u00ADpers with ma\u00ADte\u00ADri\u00ADal equal\u00ADly good or bet\u00ADter than they re\u00ADceived from the oth\u00ADers.

It hap\u00ADpened, in this case, that I wanted that vol\u00ADume of Rus\u00ADkin about a week ago; but when I went to the shelf for it, it was gone. I knew I must have lent it, but to whom I could not re\u00ADmem\u00ADber. Dur\u00ADing the past week, I be\u00ADgan to de\u00ADmand the book of eve\u00ADry friend I met to whom I might have lent it. Of course, eve\u00ADry one of them pro\u00ADtested in\u00ADno\u00ADcence; but at last I've struck the guilty man. I shall know, in fu\u00ADture, how to find my mis\u00ADsing books.
