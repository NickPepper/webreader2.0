If I went to a gro\u00ADcery store to buy a peck of potatoes, and a po\u00ADta\u00ADto rolled off the heap\u00ADing meas\u00ADure, the gro\u00ADcer\u00ADy\u00ADman, in\u00ADstead of pick\u00ADing it up, kicked it into the gut\u00ADter for the wheels of his wag\u00ADon to run over. The butch\u00ADer's waste filled my moth\u00ADer's soul with dis\u00ADmay. If I bought a scut\u00ADtle of coal at the cor\u00ADner gro\u00ADcery, the coal that missed the scut\u00ADtle, in\u00ADstead of be\u00ADing shov\u00ADelled up and put back into the bin, was swept into the street.

A half pan of hom\u00ADi\u00ADny of the pre\u00ADced\u00ADing day's break\u00ADfast lay in the pail next to a third of a loaf of bread. In lat\u00ADer years, when I saw, dai\u00ADly, a scow load\u00ADed with the gar\u00ADbage of Brook\u00ADlyn house\u00ADhold\u00ADers be\u00ADing towed through New York har\u00ADbor out to sea, it was an easy cal\u00ADcu\u00ADla\u00ADtion that what was thrown away in a week's time from Brook\u00ADlyn homes would feed the poor of the Neth\u00ADer\u00ADlands."
