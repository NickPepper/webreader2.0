I do not for a mo\u00ADment im\u00ADag\u00ADine that any part of what I have to re\u00ADlate can be in\u00ADter\u00ADest\u00ADing to the pub\u00ADlic as a nar\u00ADra\u00ADtive or as be\u00ADing con\u00ADnect\u00ADed with my\u00ADself. But I have thought that in an age in which ed\u00ADu\u00ADca\u00ADtion and its im\u00ADprove\u00ADment are the sub\u00ADject of more, if not of profounder, study than at any for\u00ADmer pe\u00ADri\u00ADod of Eng\u00ADlish his\u00ADto\u00ADry, it may be use\u00ADful that there should be some re\u00ADcord of an ed\u00ADu\u00ADca\u00ADtion which was un\u00ADu\u00ADsu\u00ADal and re\u00ADmark\u00ADa\u00ADble, and which, what\u00ADev\u00ADer else it may have done, has proved how much more than is com\u00ADmon\u00ADly sup\u00ADposed may be taught, and well taught, in those ear\u00ADly years which, in the com\u00ADmon modes of what is called in\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion, are lit\u00ADtle bet\u00ADter than wast\u00ADed. It has also seemed to me that in an age of tran\u00ADsi\u00ADtion in opin\u00ADions, there may be some\u00ADwhat both of in\u00ADter\u00ADest and of ben\u00ADe\u00ADfit in not\u00ADing the suc\u00ADces\u00ADsive phases of any mind which was al\u00ADways press\u00ADing for\u00ADward, equal\u00ADly ready to learn and to un\u00ADlearn ei\u00ADther from its own thoughts or from those of oth\u00ADers. But a mo\u00ADtive which weighs more with me than ei\u00ADther of these, is a de\u00ADsire to make ac\u00ADknowl\u00ADedg\u00ADment of the debts which my in\u00ADtel\u00ADlec\u00ADtu\u00ADal and mor\u00ADal de\u00ADvel\u00ADop\u00ADment owes to oth\u00ADer per\u00ADsons; some of them of rec\u00ADog\u00ADnised em\u00ADi\u00ADnence, oth\u00ADers less known than they de\u00ADserve to be, and the one to whom most of all is due, one whom the world had no op\u00ADpor\u00ADtu\u00ADni\u00ADty of know\u00ADing. The read\u00ADer whom these things do not in\u00ADter\u00ADest, has only him\u00ADself to blame if he reads far\u00ADther, and I do not de\u00ADsire any oth\u00ADer in\u00ADdul\u00ADgence from him than that of bear\u00ADing in mind that for him these pages were not writ\u00ADten."

The first is, that in his po\u00ADsi\u00ADtion, with no re\u00ADsource but the pre\u00ADcar\u00ADi\u00ADous one of writ\u00ADing in pe\u00ADri\u00ADod\u00ADi\u00ADcals, he mar\u00ADried and had a large fam\u00ADi\u00ADly; con\u00ADduct than which noth\u00ADing could be more opposed, both as a mat\u00ADter of good sense and of duty, to the opin\u00ADions which, at least at a lat\u00ADer pe\u00ADri\u00ADod of life, he stren\u00ADu\u00ADous\u00ADly up\u00ADheld. The oth\u00ADer cir\u00ADcum\u00ADstance, is the ex\u00ADtraor\u00ADdi\u00ADnary en\u00ADer\u00ADgy which was re\u00ADquired to lead the life he led, with the dis\u00ADad\u00ADvan\u00ADtages un\u00ADder which he la\u00ADboured from the first, and with those which he brought upon him\u00ADself by his mar\u00ADriage. It would have been no small thing, had he done no more than to sup\u00ADport him\u00ADself and his fam\u00ADi\u00ADly dur\u00ADing so many years by writ\u00ADing, with\u00ADout ever be\u00ADing in debt, or in any pe\u00ADcu\u00ADni\u00ADary dif\u00ADfi\u00ADcul\u00ADty; hold\u00ADing, as he did, opin\u00ADions, both in pol\u00ADi\u00ADtics and in re\u00ADli\u00ADgion, which were more odi\u00ADous to all per\u00ADsons of in\u00ADflu\u00ADence, and to the com\u00ADmon run of pros\u00ADper\u00ADous Englishmen, in that gen\u00ADer\u00ADa\u00ADtion than ei\u00ADther be\u00ADfore or since; and be\u00ADing not only a man whom noth\u00ADing would have in\u00ADduced to write against his con\u00ADvic\u00ADtions, but one who in\u00ADvar\u00ADi\u00ADa\u00ADbly threw into eve\u00ADry\u00ADthing he wrote, as much of his con\u00ADvic\u00ADtions as he thought the cir\u00ADcum\u00ADstances would in any way per\u00ADmit: be\u00ADing, it must also be said, one who nev\u00ADer did an\u00ADy\u00ADthing neg\u00ADli\u00ADgent\u00ADly; nev\u00ADer un\u00ADder\u00ADtook any task, lit\u00ADer\u00ADary or oth\u00ADer, on which he did not con\u00ADsci\u00ADen\u00ADtious\u00ADly be\u00ADstow all the la\u00ADbour nec\u00ADes\u00ADsary for per\u00ADform\u00ADing it ad\u00ADe\u00ADquate\u00ADly. But he, with these bur\u00ADdens on him, planned, com\u00ADmenced, and com\u00ADplet\u00ADed, the _His\u00ADto\u00ADry of In\u00ADdia_; and this in the course of about ten years, a shorter time than has been occupied (even by writ\u00ADers who had no oth\u00ADer em\u00ADploy\u00ADment) in the pro\u00ADduc\u00ADtion of al\u00ADmost any oth\u00ADer his\u00ADtor\u00ADi\u00ADcal work of equal bulk, and of an\u00ADy\u00ADthing ap\u00ADproach\u00ADing to the same amount of read\u00ADing and re\u00ADsearch.

I have no re\u00ADmem\u00ADbrance of the time when I be\u00ADgan to learn Greek; I have been told that it was when I was three years old. My ear\u00ADli\u00ADest rec\u00ADol\u00ADlec\u00ADtion on the sub\u00ADject, is that of com\u00ADmit\u00ADting to mem\u00ADo\u00ADry what my fa\u00ADther termed vo\u00ADca\u00ADbles, be\u00ADing lists of com\u00ADmon Greek words, with their sig\u00ADni\u00ADfi\u00ADca\u00ADtion in Eng\u00ADlish, which he wrote out for me on cards. Of gram\u00ADmar, un\u00ADtil some years lat\u00ADer, I learnt no more than the in\u00ADflec\u00ADtions of the nouns and verbs, but, af\u00ADter a course of vo\u00ADca\u00ADbles, pro\u00ADceeded at once to trans\u00ADla\u00ADtion; and I faint\u00ADly re\u00ADmem\u00ADber go\u00ADing through Ae\u00ADsop's _Fa\u00ADbles_, the first Greek book which I read. The _Anab\u00ADa\u00ADsis_, which I re\u00ADmem\u00ADber bet\u00ADter, was the se\u00ADcond. I learnt no Lat\u00ADin un\u00ADtil my eighth year. At that time I had read, un\u00ADder my fa\u00ADther's tu\u00ADi\u00ADtion, a num\u00ADber of Greek prose au\u00ADthors, among whom I re\u00ADmem\u00ADber the whole of He\u00ADrod\u00ADo\u00ADtus, and of Xen\u00ADo\u00ADphon's <i>Cyropaedia</i> and _Me\u00ADmo\u00ADri\u00ADals of Soc\u00ADra\u00ADtes_; some of the lives of the phi\u00ADlos\u00ADo\u00ADphers by Di\u00ADog\u00ADe\u00ADnes Laertius; part of Lu\u00ADci\u00ADan, and Isoc\u00ADra\u00ADtes ad Demonicum and Ad Nicoclem. I also read, in 1813, the first six di\u00ADa\u00ADlogues (in the com\u00ADmon ar\u00ADrange\u00ADment) of Pla\u00ADto, from the Euthyphron to the Theoctetus in\u00ADclu\u00ADsive: which last di\u00ADa\u00ADlogue, I ven\u00ADture to think, would have been bet\u00ADter omit\u00ADted, as it was to\u00ADtal\u00ADly im\u00ADpos\u00ADsi\u00ADble I should un\u00ADder\u00ADstand it. But my fa\u00ADther, in all his teach\u00ADing, de\u00ADmanded of me not only the ut\u00ADmost that I could do, but much that I could by no pos\u00ADsi\u00ADbil\u00ADi\u00ADty have done. What he was him\u00ADself will\u00ADing to un\u00ADder\u00ADgo for the sake of my in\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion, may be judged from the fact, that I went through the whole pro\u00ADcess of pre\u00ADpar\u00ADing my Greek les\u00ADsons in the same room and at the same ta\u00ADble at which he was writ\u00ADing: and as in those days Greek and Eng\u00ADlish lex\u00ADi\u00ADcons were not, and I could make no more use of a Greek and Lat\u00ADin lex\u00ADi\u00ADcon than could be made with\u00ADout hav\u00ADing yet be\u00ADgun to learn Lat\u00ADin, I was forced to have re\u00ADcourse to him for the mean\u00ADing of eve\u00ADry word which I did not know. This in\u00ADces\u00ADsant in\u00ADter\u00ADrup\u00ADtion, he, one of the most im\u00ADpa\u00ADtient of men, sub\u00ADmit\u00ADted to, and wrote un\u00ADder that in\u00ADter\u00ADrup\u00ADtion sev\u00ADer\u00ADal vol\u00ADumes of his His\u00ADto\u00ADry and all else that he had to write dur\u00ADing those years."
