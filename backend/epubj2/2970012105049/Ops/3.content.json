Then each one seemed to melt into the moun\u00ADtain side, van\u00ADish\u00ADing like mag\u00ADic among the grass and stones. I won\u00ADdered mild\u00ADly why they had con\u00ADcealed them\u00ADselves so sud\u00ADden\u00ADly, but a mo\u00ADment lat\u00ADer there sounded a sub\u00ADdued whir, like the mo\u00ADtor of an aer\u00ADo\u00ADplane far up in the sky. Three shad\u00ADows drifted over, and I saw three huge black ea\u00ADgles swing\u00ADing in ever low\u00ADer\u00ADing cir\u00ADcles about our heads. I knew then that the par\u00ADtridg\u00ADes had sought the pro\u00ADtec\u00ADtion of our pres\u00ADence from their mor\u00ADtal enemies, the ea\u00ADgles."
