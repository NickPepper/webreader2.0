Po\u00ADmo\u00ADna was of this class, and no one ex\u00ADcelled her in love of the gar\u00ADden and the cul\u00ADture of fruit. She cared not for orests and riv\u00ADers, but loved the cul\u00ADti\u00ADvat\u00ADed coun\u00ADtry, and trees that bear de\u00ADli\u00ADcious ap\u00ADples. Her right hand bore for its weap\u00ADon not a jave\u00ADlin, but a prun\u00ADing-knife. Armed with this, she bus\u00ADied her\u00ADself at one time to re\u00ADpress the too lux\u00ADu\u00ADri\u00ADant growths, and cur\u00ADtail the branches that straggled out of place; at an\u00ADoth\u00ADer, to split the twig and in\u00ADsert there\u00ADin a graft, mak\u00ADing the branch adopt a nurs\u00ADling not its own. She took care, too, that her fa\u00ADvor\u00ADites should not suf\u00ADfer from drought, and led streams of wa\u00ADter by them, that the thirsty roots might drink. This oc\u00ADcu\u00ADpa\u00ADtion was her pur\u00ADsuit, her pas\u00ADsion; and she was free from that which Ve\u00ADnus in\u00ADspires. She was not with\u00ADout fear of the coun\u00ADtry peo\u00ADple, and kept her or\u00ADchard locked, and al\u00ADlowed not men to en\u00ADter. The Fauns and Sa\u00ADtyrs would have giv\u00ADen all they pos\u00ADsessed to win her, and so would old Syl\u00ADva\u00ADnus, who looks young for his years, and Pan, who wears a gar\u00ADland of pine leaves around his head. But Ver\u00ADtum\u00ADnus loved her best of all; yet he sped no bet\u00ADter than the rest. O how of\u00ADten, in the dis\u00ADguise of a reap\u00ADer, did he bring her corn in a bas\u00ADket, and looked the very im\u00ADage of a reap\u00ADer! With a hay band tied round him, one would think he had just come from turn\u00ADing over the grass. Some\u00ADtimes he would have an ox-goad in his hand, and you would have said he had just unyoked his wea\u00ADry oxen. Now he bore a prun\u00ADing-hook, and per\u00ADson\u00ADat\u00ADed a vine-dress\u00ADer; and again, with a lad\u00ADder on his shoul\u00ADder, he seemed as if he was go\u00ADing to gath\u00ADer ap\u00ADples. Some\u00ADtimes he trudged along as a discharged sol\u00ADdier, and again he bore a fish\u00ADing-rod, as if go\u00ADing to fish. In this way he gained ad\u00ADmis\u00ADsion to her again and again, and fed his pas\u00ADsion with the sight of her."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/7","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/8","J":"One day he came in the guise of an old wom\u00ADan, her gray hair sur\u00ADmounted with a cap, and a staff in her hand. She en\u00ADtered the gar\u00ADden and ad\u00ADmired the fruit. \"It does you cred\u00ADit, my dear,\" she said, and kissed her, not ex\u00ADact\u00ADly with an old wom\u00ADan's kiss. She sat down on a bank, and looked up at the branches lad\u00ADen with fruit which hung over her. Op\u00ADpo\u00ADsite was an elm en\u00ADtwined with a vine load\u00ADed with swell\u00ADing grapes. She praised the tree and its as\u00ADso\u00ADci\u00ADat\u00ADed vine, equal\u00ADly. \"But,\" said she, \"if the tree stood alone, and had no vine cling\u00ADing to it, it would have noth\u00ADing to at\u00ADtract or of\u00ADfer us but its use\u00ADless leaves. And equal\u00ADly the vine, if it were not twined round the elm, would lie pros\u00ADtrate on the ground. Why will you not take a les\u00ADson from the tree and the vine, and con\u00ADsent to unite your\u00ADself with some one? I wish you would. Hel\u00ADen her\u00ADself had not more nu\u00ADmer\u00ADous suit\u00ADors, nor Pe\u00ADnel\u00ADo\u00ADpe, the wife of shrewd Ulys\u00ADses. Even while you spurn them, they court you,--ru\u00ADral deities and oth\u00ADers of eve\u00ADry kind that fre\u00ADquent these moun\u00ADtains. But if you are pru\u00ADdent and want to make a good al\u00ADli\u00ADance, and will let an old wom\u00ADan ad\u00ADvise you,--who loves you bet\u00ADter than you have any idea of,--dis\u00ADmiss all the rest and ac\u00ADcept Ver\u00ADtum\u00ADnus, on my rec\u00ADom\u00ADmen\u00ADda\u00ADtion. I know him as well as he knows him\u00ADself. He is not a wan\u00ADder\u00ADing de\u00ADi\u00ADty, but be\u00ADlongs to these moun\u00ADtains. Nor is he like too many of the lov\u00ADers now\u00ADa\u00ADdays, who love any one they hap\u00ADpen to see; he loves you, and you only. Add to this, he is young and hand\u00ADsome, and has the art of as\u00ADsum\u00ADing any shape he pleases, and can make him\u00ADself just what you com\u00ADmand him. More\u00ADo\u00ADver, he loves the same things that you do, de\u00ADlights in gar\u00ADden\u00ADing, and han\u00ADdles your ap\u00ADples with ad\u00ADmi\u00ADra\u00ADtion. But NOW he cares noth\u00ADing for fruits nor flow\u00ADers, nor an\u00ADy\u00ADthing else, but only your\u00ADself. Take pity on him, and fan\u00ADcy him speak\u00ADing now with my mouth. Re\u00ADmem\u00ADber that the gods pun\u00ADish cru\u00ADel\u00ADty, and that Ve\u00ADnus hates a hard heart, and will vis\u00ADit such of\u00ADfences soon\u00ADer or lat\u00ADer. To prove this, let me tell you a sto\u00ADry, which is well known in Cy\u00ADprus to be a fact; and I hope it will have the ef\u00ADfect to make you more mer\u00ADci\u00ADful."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/9","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/10","J":"\"Iphis was a young man of hum\u00ADble par\u00ADent\u00ADage, who saw and loved An\u00ADax\u00ADar\u00ADe\u00ADte, a no\u00ADble lady of the an\u00ADcient fam\u00ADi\u00ADly of Teu\u00ADcer. He struggled long with his pas\u00ADsion, but when he found he could not sub\u00ADdue it, he came a sup\u00ADpli\u00ADant to her man\u00ADsion.
