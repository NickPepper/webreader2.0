And she light\u00ADed a can\u00ADdle, that he might have light to do so. \"Leave there the can\u00ADdle,\" said he, \"and de\u00ADsire the man of the house to come here.\" Then she went, and the man of the house came to him. \"Dost thou know how much I owe thee?\" asked Ge\u00ADraint. \"I think thou owest but lit\u00ADtle.\" \"Take the three hors\u00ADes and the three suits of ar\u00ADmor.\" \"Heav\u00ADen re\u00ADward thee, lord,\" said he, \"but I spent not the val\u00ADue of one suit of ar\u00ADmor upon thee.\" \"For that rea\u00ADson,\" said he, \"thou wilt be the richer. And now, wilt thou come to guide me out of the town?\" \"I will glad\u00ADly,\" said he; \"and in which di\u00ADrec\u00ADtion dost thou in\u00ADtend to go?\" \"I wish to leave the town by a dif\u00ADfer\u00ADent way from that by which I en\u00ADtered it.\" So the man of the lodg\u00ADings ac\u00ADcom\u00ADpa\u00ADnied him as far as he de\u00ADsired. Then he bade the maid\u00ADen to go on be\u00ADfore him, and she did so, and went straight for\u00ADward, and his host re\u00ADturned home."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/37","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/38","J":"And Ge\u00ADraint and the maid\u00ADen went for\u00ADward along the high-road. And as they jour\u00ADneyed thus, they heard an ex\u00ADceed\u00ADing loud wail\u00ADing near to them. \"Stay thou here,\" said he, \"and I will go and see what is the cause of this wail\u00ADing.\" \"I will,\" said she. Then he went for\u00ADward into an open glade that was near the road. And in the glade he saw two hors\u00ADes, one hav\u00ADing a man's sad\u00ADdle, and the oth\u00ADer a wom\u00ADan's sad\u00ADdle upon it. And be\u00ADhold there was a knight ly\u00ADing dead in his ar\u00ADmor, and a young dam\u00ADsel in a rid\u00ADing-dress stand\u00ADing over him la\u00ADment\u00ADing. \"Ah, lady,\" said Ge\u00ADraint, \"what hath be\u00ADfall\u00ADen thee?\" \"Be\u00ADhold,\" she an\u00ADswered, \"I jour\u00ADneyed here with my be\u00ADlov\u00ADed hus\u00ADband, when lo! three gi\u00ADants came upon us, and with\u00ADout any cause in the world, they slew him.\" \"Which way went they hence?\" said Ge\u00ADraint. \"Yon\u00ADder by the high-road,\" she replied. So he re\u00ADturned to Enid. \"Go,\" said he, \"to the lady that is be\u00ADlow yon\u00ADder, and await me there till I come.\" She was sad when he or\u00ADdered her to do thus, but nev\u00ADer\u00ADthe\u00ADless she went to the dam\u00ADsel, whom it was ruth to hear, and she felt cer\u00ADtain that Ge\u00ADraint would nev\u00ADer re\u00ADturn."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/39","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/40","J":"Mean\u00ADwhile Ge\u00ADraint fol\u00ADlowed the gi\u00ADants, and over\u00ADtook them. And each of them was great\u00ADer in stat\u00ADure than three oth\u00ADer men, and a huge club was on the shoul\u00ADder of each. Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his body. And hav\u00ADing drawn it forth again, he pierced an\u00ADoth\u00ADer of them through like\u00ADwise. But the third turned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his shield and crushed his shoul\u00ADder. But Ge\u00ADraint drew his sword and gave the gi\u00ADant a blow on the crown of his head, so se\u00ADvere, and fierce, and vi\u00ADo\u00ADlent, that his head and his neck were split down to his shoul\u00ADders, and he fell dead. So Ge\u00ADraint left him thus and re\u00ADturned to Enid. And when he reached the place where she was he fell down life\u00ADless from his horse. Pierc\u00ADing and loud and thrill\u00ADing was the cry that Enid ut\u00ADtered. And she came and stood over him where he had fall\u00ADen. And at the sound of her cries came the Earl of Limours, and they who jour\u00ADneyed with him, whom her la\u00ADmen\u00ADta\u00ADtions brought out of their road. And the earl said to Enid, \"Alas, lady, what hath be\u00ADfall\u00ADen thee?\" \"Ah, good sir,\" said she, \"the only man I have loved, or ever shall love, is slain.\" Then he said to the oth\u00ADer, \"And what is the cause of thy grief?\" \"They have slain my be\u00ADlov\u00ADed hus\u00ADband also,\" said she. \"And who was it that slew them?\" \"Some gi\u00ADants,\" she an\u00ADswered, \"slew my best-be\u00ADlov\u00ADed, and the oth\u00ADer knight went in pur\u00ADsuit of them, and came back in the state thou seest.\" The earl caused the knight that was dead to be bur\u00ADied, but he thought that there still re\u00ADmained some life in Ge\u00ADraint; and to see if he yet would live, he had him car\u00ADried with him in the hol\u00ADlow of his shield, and upon a bier. And the two dam\u00ADsels went to the court; and when they ar\u00ADrived there, Ge\u00ADraint was placed upon a lit\u00ADtle couch in front of the ta\u00ADble that was in the hall. Then they all took off their trav\u00ADel\u00ADing-gear, and the earl be\u00ADsought Enid to do the same, and to clothe her\u00ADself in oth\u00ADer gar\u00ADments. \"I will not, by Heav\u00ADen,\" said she. \"Ah, lady,\" said he, \"be not so sorrowful for this mat\u00ADter.\" \"It were hard to per\u00ADsuade me to be oth\u00ADer\u00ADwise,\" said she. \"I will act to\u00ADwards thee in such wise that thou needest not be sorrowful, wheth\u00ADer yon\u00ADder knight live or die. Be\u00ADhold, a good earl\u00ADdom, to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer with my\u00ADself, will I be\u00ADstow upon thee; be there\u00ADfore hap\u00ADpy and joy\u00ADful.\" \"I de\u00ADclare to Heav\u00ADen,\" said she, \"that hence\u00ADforth I shall nev\u00ADer be joy\u00ADful while I live.\" \"Come,\" said he, \"and eat.\" \"No, by Heav\u00ADen, I will not.\" \"But, by Heav\u00ADen, thou shalt,\" said he. So he took her with him to the ta\u00ADble against her will, and many times de\u00ADsired her to eat. \"I call Heav\u00ADen to wit\u00ADness,\" said she, \"that I will not un\u00ADtil the man that is upon yon\u00ADder bier shall eat like\u00ADwise.\" \"Thou canst not ful\u00ADfil that,\" said the earl, \"yon\u00ADder man is dead al\u00ADready.\" \"I will prove that I can,\" said she. Then he of\u00ADfered her a gob\u00ADlet of liq\u00ADuor. \"Drink this gob\u00ADlet,\" he said, \"and it will cause thee to change thy mind.\" \"Evil be\u00ADtide me,\" she an\u00ADswered, \"if I drink aught un\u00ADtil he drink also.\" \"Tru\u00ADly,\" said the earl, \"it is of no more avail for me to be gen\u00ADtle with thee than un\u00ADgen\u00ADtle.\" And he gave her a box in the ear. There\u00ADup\u00ADon she raised a loud and pierc\u00ADing shriek, and her la\u00ADmen\u00ADta\u00ADtions were much great\u00ADer than they had been be\u00ADfore; for she con\u00ADsid\u00ADered in her mind, that, had Ge\u00ADraint been alive, he durst not have struck her thus. But, be\u00ADhold, at the sound of her cry, Ge\u00ADraint re\u00ADvived from his swoon, and he sat upon the bier; and find\u00ADing his sword in the hol\u00ADlow of his shield, he rushed to the place where the earl was, and struck him a fierce\u00ADly-wound\u00ADing, se\u00ADvere\u00ADly-ven\u00ADom\u00ADous, and sternly-smit\u00ADing blow upon the crown of his head, so that he clove him in twain, un\u00ADtil his sword was staid by the ta\u00ADble. Then all left the board and fled away. And this was not so much through fear of the liv\u00ADing, as through the dread they felt at see\u00ADing the dead man rise up to slay them. And Ge\u00ADraint looked upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was to see that Enid had lost her col\u00ADor and her wont\u00ADed as\u00ADpect; and the oth\u00ADer, to know that she was in the right. \"Lady,\" said he, \"knowest thou where our hors\u00ADes are?\" \"I know, lord, where thy horse is,\" she replied, \"but I know not where is the oth\u00ADer. Thy horse is in the house yon\u00ADder.\" So he went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mount\u00ADed him, and took up Enid, and placed her upon the horse with him. And he rode for\u00ADward. And their road lay be\u00ADtween two hedges; and the night was gain\u00ADing on the day. And lo! they saw be\u00ADhind them the shafts of spears be\u00ADtwixt them and the sky, and they heard the tramp\u00ADing of hors\u00ADes, and the noise of a host ap\u00ADproach\u00ADing. \"I hear some\u00ADthing fol\u00ADlow\u00ADing us,\" said he, \"and I will put thee on the oth\u00ADer side of the hedge.\" And thus he did. And there\u00ADup\u00ADon, be\u00ADhold a knight pricked to\u00ADwards him, and couched his lance. When Enid saw this, she cried out, say\u00ADing, \"O chief\u00ADtain, who\u00ADev\u00ADer thou art, what re\u00ADnown wilt thou gain by slay\u00ADing a dead man?\" \"O Heav\u00ADen!\" said he, \"is it Ge\u00ADraint?\" \"Yes, in truth,\" said she; \"and who art thou?\" \"I am Gwiffert Pet\u00ADit,\" said he, \"thy hus\u00ADband's ally, com\u00ADing to thy as\u00ADsis\u00ADtance, for I heard that thou wast in trou\u00ADble. Come with me to the court of a son-in-law of my sis\u00ADter, which is near here, and thou shalt have the best med\u00ADi\u00ADcal as\u00ADsis\u00ADtance in the king\u00ADdom.\" \"I will do so glad\u00ADly,\" said Ge\u00ADraint. And Enid was placed upon the horse of one of Gwiffert's squires, and they went for\u00ADward to the bar\u00ADon's pal\u00ADace. And they were re\u00ADceived there with glad\u00ADness, and they met with hos\u00ADpi\u00ADtal\u00ADi\u00ADty and at\u00ADten\u00ADtion. The next morn\u00ADing they went to seek phy\u00ADsi\u00ADcians; and it was not long be\u00ADfore they came, and they at\u00ADtended Ge\u00ADraint un\u00ADtil he was per\u00ADfect\u00ADly well. And while Ge\u00ADraint was un\u00ADder med\u00ADi\u00ADcal care Gwiffert caused his ar\u00ADmor to be re\u00ADpaired, un\u00ADtil it was as good as it had ever been. And they re\u00ADmained there a month and a fort\u00ADnight. Then they sep\u00ADa\u00ADrat\u00ADed, and Ge\u00ADraint went to\u00ADwards his own do\u00ADmin\u00ADions, and thence\u00ADforth he reigned prosperously, and his war\u00ADlike fame and splen\u00ADdor lasted with re\u00ADnown and hon\u00ADor, both to him and to Enid, from that time for\u00ADward."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/41","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/42","J":"[Foot\u00ADnote: Through\u00ADout the broad and var\u00ADied re\u00ADgion of ro\u00ADmance it would be dif\u00ADfi\u00ADcult to find a char\u00ADac\u00ADter of great\u00ADer sim\u00ADplic\u00ADi\u00ADty and truth than that of Enid, the daugh\u00ADter of Earl Ynywl.
