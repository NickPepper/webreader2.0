Ni\u00ADsus was king of Meg\u00ADa\u00ADra, and Scyl\u00ADla was his daugh\u00ADter. The siege had now lasted six months and the city still held out, for it was de\u00ADcreed by fate that it should not be tak\u00ADen so long as a cer\u00ADtain pur\u00ADple lock, which glit\u00ADtered among the hair of King Ni\u00ADsus, re\u00ADmained on his head. There was a tow\u00ADer on the city walls, which over\u00ADlooked the plain where Mi\u00ADnos and his army were en\u00ADcamped. To this tow\u00ADer Scyl\u00ADla used to re\u00ADpair, and look abroad over the tents of the hos\u00ADtile army. The siege had lasted so long that she had learn\u00ADed to dis\u00ADtin\u00ADguish the per\u00ADsons of the lead\u00ADers. Mi\u00ADnos, in par\u00ADtic\u00ADu\u00ADlar, ex\u00ADcit\u00ADed her ad\u00ADmi\u00ADra\u00ADtion. Ar\u00ADrayed in his hel\u00ADmet, and bear\u00ADing his shield, she ad\u00ADmired his grace\u00ADful de\u00ADport\u00ADment; if he threw his jave\u00ADlin skill seemed com\u00ADbined with force in the dis\u00ADcharge; if he drew his bow Apol\u00ADlo him\u00ADself could not have done it more grace\u00ADful\u00ADly. But when he laid aside his hel\u00ADmet, and in his pur\u00ADple robes bestrode his white horse with its gay ca\u00ADpar\u00ADi\u00ADsons, and reined in its foam\u00ADing mouth, the daugh\u00ADter of Ni\u00ADsus was hard\u00ADly mis\u00ADtress of her\u00ADself; she was al\u00ADmost fran\u00ADtic with ad\u00ADmi\u00ADra\u00ADtion. She en\u00ADvied the weap\u00ADon that he grasped, the reins that he held. She felt as if she could, if it were pos\u00ADsi\u00ADble, go to him through the hos\u00ADtile ranks; she felt an im\u00ADpulse to cast her\u00ADself down from the tow\u00ADer into the midst of his camp, or to open the gates to him, or to do an\u00ADy\u00ADthing else, so only it might grat\u00ADi\u00ADfy Mi\u00ADnos. As she sat in the tow\u00ADer, she talked thus with her\u00ADself: \"I know not wheth\u00ADer to re\u00ADjoice or grieve at this sad war. I grieve that Mi\u00ADnos is our en\u00ADe\u00ADmy; but I re\u00ADjoice at any cause that brings him to my sight. Per\u00ADhaps he would be will\u00ADing to grant us peace, and re\u00ADceive me as a hos\u00ADtage. I would fly down, if I could, and alight in his camp, and tell him that we yield our\u00ADselves to his mer\u00ADcy. But then, to be\u00ADtray my fa\u00ADther! No! ra\u00ADther would I nev\u00ADer see Mi\u00ADnos again. And yet no doubt it is some\u00ADtimes the best thing for a city to be con\u00ADquered, when the con\u00ADquer\u00ADor is clem\u00ADent and gen\u00ADer\u00ADous. Mi\u00ADnos cer\u00ADtain\u00ADly has right on his side. I think we shall be con\u00ADquered; and if that must be the end of it, why should not love un\u00ADbar the gates to him, in\u00ADstead of leav\u00ADing it to be done by war? Bet\u00ADter spare de\u00ADlay and slaugh\u00ADter if we can. And O if any one should wound or kill Mi\u00ADnos! No one sure\u00ADly would have the heart to do it; yet ig\u00ADno\u00ADrant\u00ADly, not know\u00ADing him, one might. I will, I will sur\u00ADren\u00ADder my\u00ADself to him, with my coun\u00ADtry as a dow\u00ADry, and so put an end to the war. But how? The gates are guard\u00ADed, and my fa\u00ADther keeps the keys; he only stands in my way. O that it might please the gods to take him away! But why ask the gods to do it? An\u00ADoth\u00ADer wom\u00ADan, lov\u00ADing as I do, would re\u00ADmove with her own hands what\u00ADev\u00ADer stood in the way of her love. And can any oth\u00ADer wom\u00ADan dare more than I? I would en\u00ADcoun\u00ADter fire and sword to gain my ob\u00ADject; but here there is no need of fire and sword. I only need my fa\u00ADther's pur\u00ADple lock.
