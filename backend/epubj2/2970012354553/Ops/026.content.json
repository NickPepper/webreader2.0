So he rode to the knights and cried to them, bid\u00ADding them cease their bat\u00ADtle, for they did them\u00ADselves great shame, so many knights to fight against one. Then an\u00ADswered the mas\u00ADter of the knights (his name was Sir Breuse sans Pitie, who was at that time the most villanous knight liv\u00ADing): \"Sir knight, what have ye to do to med\u00ADdle with us? If ye be wise de\u00ADpart on your way as you came, for this knight shall not es\u00ADcape us.\" \"That were pity,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"that so good a knight should be slain so cow\u00ADard\u00ADly; there\u00ADfore I warn you I will suc\u00ADcor him with all my pu\u00ADis\u00ADsance.\""},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/7","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/8","J":"Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram alight\u00ADed off his horse, be\u00ADcause they were on foot, that they should not slay his horse. And he smote on the right hand and on the left so vig\u00ADor\u00ADous\u00ADly that well-nigh at eve\u00ADry stroke he struck down a knight. At last they fled, with Breuse sans Pitie, into the tow\u00ADer, and shut Sir Tris\u00ADtram with\u00ADout the gate. Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram re\u00ADturned back to the res\u00ADcued knight, and found him sit\u00ADting un\u00ADder a tree, sore wound\u00ADed. \"Fair knight,\" said he, \"how is it with you?\" \"Sir knight,\" said Sir Palamedes, for he it was, \"I thank you of your great good\u00ADness, for ye have res\u00ADcued me from death.\" \"What is your name?\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram. He said, \"My name is Sir Palamedes.\" \"Say ye so?\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram; \"now know that thou art the man in the world that I most hate; there\u00ADfore make thee ready, for I will do bat\u00ADtle with thee.\" \"What is your name?\" said Sir Palamedes. \"My name is Sir Tris\u00ADtram, your mor\u00ADtal en\u00ADe\u00ADmy.\" \"It may be so,\" said Sir Palamedes; \"but you have done over\u00ADmuch for me this day, that I should fight with you. More\u00ADo\u00ADver, it will be no hon\u00ADor for you to have to do with me, for you are fresh and I am wound\u00ADed.

Then they de\u00ADpart\u00ADed and took their ways di\u00ADverse. Sir Tris\u00ADtram passed through a great for\u00ADest into a plain, till he came to a pri\u00ADory, and there he re\u00ADposed him with a good man six days."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/9","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/10","J":"Then de\u00ADpart\u00ADed Sir Tris\u00ADtram, and rode straight into Cam\u00ADe\u00ADlot to the mon\u00ADu\u00ADment of Mer\u00ADlin, and there he looked about him for Sir Palamedes. And he perceived a seem\u00ADly knight, who came rid\u00ADing against him all in white, with a cov\u00ADered shield. When he came nigh Sir Tris\u00ADtram said aloud, \"Wel\u00ADcome, sir knight, and well and tru\u00ADly have you kept your prom\u00ADise.\" Then they made ready their shields and spears, and came to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer with all the might of their hors\u00ADes, so fierce\u00ADly, that both the hors\u00ADes and the knights fell to the earth. And as soon as they might they quitted their hors\u00ADes, and struck to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer with bright swords as men of might, and each wound\u00ADed the oth\u00ADer won\u00ADder\u00ADful\u00ADly sore, so that the blood ran out upon the grass. Thus they fought for the space of four hours and nev\u00ADer one would speak to the oth\u00ADer one word. Then at last spake the white knight, and said, \"Sir, thou fightest won\u00ADder\u00ADful well, as ever I saw knight; there\u00ADfore, if it please you, tell me your name.\" \"Why dost thou ask my name?\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram; \"art thou not Sir Palamedes?\" \"No, fair knight,\" said he, \"I am Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot of the Lake.\" \"Alas!\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"what have I done? for you are the man of the world that I love best.\" \"Fair knight,\" said Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot, \"tell me your name.\" \"Tru\u00ADly,\" said he, \"my name is Sir Tris\u00ADtram de Lionesse.\" \"Alas! alas!\" said Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot, \"what ad\u00ADven\u00ADture has be\u00ADfall\u00ADen me!\" And there\u00ADwith Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword; and Sir Tris\u00ADtram kneeled down and yielded him up his sword; and so ei\u00ADther gave oth\u00ADer the de\u00ADgree. And then they both went to the stone, and sat them down upon it and took off their helms and each kissed the oth\u00ADer a hun\u00ADdred times. And then anon they rode to\u00ADward Cam\u00ADe\u00ADlot, and on the way they met with Sir Ga\u00ADwain and Sir Gaheris, that had made prom\u00ADise to Ar\u00ADthur nev\u00ADer to come again to the court till they had brought Sir Tris\u00ADtram with them."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/11","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/12","J":"\"Re\u00ADturn again,\" said Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot, \"for your quest is done; for I have met with Sir Tris\u00ADtram.

Then King Ar\u00ADthur took Sir Tris\u00ADtram by the hand, and went to the Ta\u00ADble Round, and Queen Guenever came, and many la\u00ADdies with her, and all the la\u00ADdies said with one voice, \"Wel\u00ADcome, Sir Tris\u00ADtram.\" \"Wel\u00ADcome,\" said the knights. \"Wel\u00ADcome,\" said Ar\u00ADthur, \"for one of the best of knights, and the gentlest of the world, and the man of most wor\u00ADship; for of all man\u00ADner of hunt\u00ADing thou bearest the prize, and of all meas\u00ADures of blow\u00ADing thou art the be\u00ADgin\u00ADning, and of all the terms of hunt\u00ADing and hawk\u00ADing ye are the in\u00ADven\u00ADtor, and of all in\u00ADstru\u00ADments of mu\u00ADsic ye are the best skilled; there\u00ADfore, gen\u00ADtle knight,\" said Ar\u00ADthur, \"ye are wel\u00ADcome to this court.\" And then King Ar\u00ADthur made Sir Tris\u00ADtram knight of the Ta\u00ADble Round with great nobley and feast\u00ADing as can be thought."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/13","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/14","J":"SIR TRIS\u00ADTRAM AS A SPORTS\u00ADMAN"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/15","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/16","J":"Tris\u00ADtram is of\u00ADten al\u00ADlud\u00ADed to by the Ro\u00ADmanc\u00ADers as the great au\u00ADthor\u00ADi\u00ADty and mod\u00ADel in all mat\u00ADters re\u00ADlat\u00ADing to the chase.
