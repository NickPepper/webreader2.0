Juno, to grat\u00ADi\u00ADfy her re\u00ADsent\u00ADment against Sem\u00ADe\u00ADle, con\u00ADtrived a plan for her de\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion. As\u00ADsum\u00ADing the form of Beroe, her aged nurse, she in\u00ADsin\u00ADu\u00ADat\u00ADed doubts wheth\u00ADer it was in\u00ADdeed Jove him\u00ADself who came as a lov\u00ADer. Heav\u00ADing a sigh, she said, \"I hope it will turn out so, but I can't help be\u00ADing afraid. Peo\u00ADple are not al\u00ADways what they pre\u00ADtend to be. If he is in\u00ADdeed Jove, make him give some proof of it. Ask him to come ar\u00ADrayed in all his splen\u00ADdors, such as he wears in heav\u00ADen. That will put the mat\u00ADter be\u00ADyond a doubt.\" Sem\u00ADe\u00ADle was persuaded to try the ex\u00ADper\u00ADi\u00ADment. She asks a fa\u00ADvor, with\u00ADout nam\u00ADing what it is.
