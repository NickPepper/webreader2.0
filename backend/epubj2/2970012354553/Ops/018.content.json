It was for venge\u00ADance upon a cai\u00ADtiff knight, who had made her lov\u00ADer cap\u00ADtive and de\u00ADspoiled her of her lands. King Ar\u00ADthur com\u00ADmanded to bring him his sword, Excalibar, and to sad\u00ADdle his steed, and rode forth with\u00ADout de\u00ADlay to right the la\u00ADdy's wrong. Ere long he reached the cas\u00ADtle of the grim bar\u00ADon, and chal\u00ADlenged him to the con\u00ADflict. But the cas\u00ADtle stood on mag\u00ADic ground, and the spell was such that no knight could tread there\u00ADon but straight his cour\u00ADage fell and his strength de\u00ADcayed. King Ar\u00ADthur felt the charm, and be\u00ADfore a blow was struck, his stur\u00ADdy limbs lost their strength, and his head grew faint. He was fain to yield him\u00ADself pris\u00ADon\u00ADer to the churl\u00ADish knight, who re\u00ADfused to re\u00ADlease him ex\u00ADcept upon con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion that he should re\u00ADturn at the end of a year, and bring a true an\u00ADswer to the ques\u00ADtion, \"What thing is it which wom\u00ADen most de\u00ADsire?\" or in de\u00ADfault there\u00ADof sur\u00ADren\u00ADder him\u00ADself and his lands. King Ar\u00ADthur ac\u00ADcept\u00ADed the terms, and gave his oath to re\u00ADturn at the time ap\u00ADpoint\u00ADed. Dur\u00ADing the year the king rode east, and he rode west, and in\u00ADquired of all whom he met what thing it is which all wom\u00ADen most de\u00ADsire. Some told him rich\u00ADes; some, pomp and state; some, mirth; some, flat\u00ADtery; and some, a gal\u00ADlant knight. But in the di\u00ADver\u00ADsi\u00ADty of an\u00ADswers he could find no sure de\u00ADpend\u00ADence. The year was well-nigh spent, when one day, as he rode thoughtfully through a for\u00ADest, he saw sit\u00ADting be\u00ADneath a tree a lady of such hid\u00ADe\u00ADous as\u00ADpect that he turned away his eyes, and when she greeted him in seem\u00ADly sort, made no an\u00ADswer. \"What wight art thou,\" the lady said, \"that will not speak to me?
