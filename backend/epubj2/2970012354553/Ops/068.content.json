Al\u00ADthea, when her son was born, be\u00ADheld the three destinies, who, as they spun their fa\u00ADtal thread, fore\u00ADtold that the life of the child should last no long\u00ADer than a brand then burn\u00ADing upon the hearth. Al\u00ADthea seized and quenched the brand, and care\u00ADful\u00ADly pre\u00ADserved it for years, while Mel\u00ADe\u00ADa\u00ADger grew to boy\u00ADhood, youth, and man\u00ADhood. It chanced, then, that OE\u00ADne\u00ADus, as he of\u00ADfered sac\u00ADri\u00ADfices to the gods, omit\u00ADted to pay due hon\u00ADors to Di\u00ADana; and she, in\u00ADdig\u00ADnant at the ne\u00ADglect, sent a wild boar of enor\u00ADmous size to lay waste the fields of Cal\u00ADy\u00ADdon. Its eyes shone with blood and fire, its bris\u00ADtles stood like threat\u00ADen\u00ADing spears, its tusks were like those of In\u00ADdi\u00ADan el\u00ADe\u00ADphants. The grow\u00ADing corn was trampled, the vines and ol\u00ADive trees laid waste, the flocks and herds were driv\u00ADen in wild con\u00ADfu\u00ADsion by the slaugh\u00ADter\u00ADing foe. All com\u00ADmon aid seemed vain; but Mel\u00ADe\u00ADa\u00ADger called on the heroes of Greece to join in a bold hunt for the rav\u00ADen\u00ADous mon\u00ADster. The\u00ADseus and his friend Pi\u00ADrith\u00ADo\u00ADus, Ja\u00ADson, Pel\u00ADe\u00ADus, af\u00ADter\u00ADwards the fa\u00ADther of Achil\u00ADles, Tel\u00ADa\u00ADmon the fa\u00ADther of Ajax, Nes\u00ADtor, then a youth, but who in his age bore arms with Achil\u00ADles and Ajax in the Tro\u00ADjan war,--these and many more joined in the en\u00ADter\u00ADprise. With them came At\u00ADa\u00ADlan\u00ADta, the daugh\u00ADter of Iasius, king of Ar\u00ADca\u00ADdia. A buck\u00ADle of pol\u00ADished gold con\u00ADfined her vest, an ivo\u00ADry quiv\u00ADer hung on her left shoul\u00ADder, and her left hand bore the bow. Her face blent fem\u00ADi\u00ADnine beau\u00ADty with the best graces of mar\u00ADtial youth.

From the wood was a de\u00ADscent to marshy ground. Here the boar, as he lay among the reeds, heard the shouts of his pur\u00ADsu\u00ADers, and rushed forth against them. One and an\u00ADoth\u00ADer is thrown down and slain. Ja\u00ADson throws his spear, with a pray\u00ADer to Di\u00ADana for suc\u00ADcess; and the fa\u00ADvor\u00ADing god\u00ADdess al\u00ADlows the weap\u00ADon to tou\u00ADch, but not to wound, re\u00ADmov\u00ADing the steel point of the spear in its flight. Nes\u00ADtor, as\u00ADsailed, seeks and finds safe\u00ADty in the branches of a tree. Tel\u00ADa\u00ADmon rushes on, but stumbling at a proj\u00ADect\u00ADing root, falls prone. But an ar\u00ADrow from At\u00ADa\u00ADlan\u00ADta at length for the first time tastes the mon\u00ADster's blood. It is a slight wound, but Mel\u00ADe\u00ADa\u00ADger sees and joy\u00ADful\u00ADly pro\u00ADclaims it. Anceus, ex\u00ADcit\u00ADed to envy by the praise giv\u00ADen to a fe\u00ADmale, loud\u00ADly pro\u00ADclaims his own val\u00ADor, and defies alike the boar and the god\u00ADdess who had sent it; but as he rushes on, the in\u00ADfu\u00ADri\u00ADat\u00ADed beast lays him low with a mor\u00ADtal wound. The\u00ADseus throws his lance, but it is turned aside by a proj\u00ADect\u00ADing bough. The dart of Ja\u00ADson miss\u00ADes its ob\u00ADject, and kills in\u00ADstead one of their own dogs. But Mel\u00ADe\u00ADa\u00ADger, af\u00ADter one un\u00ADsuc\u00ADcess\u00ADful stroke, drives his spear into the mon\u00ADster's side, then rushes on and despatches him with re\u00ADpeat\u00ADed blows."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/9","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/10","J":"Then rose a shout from those around; they con\u00ADgrat\u00ADu\u00ADlat\u00ADed the con\u00ADquer\u00ADor, crowd\u00ADing to tou\u00ADch his hand.

The fa\u00ADtal brand, which once she res\u00ADcued from the flames, the brand which the destinies had linked with Mel\u00ADe\u00ADa\u00ADger's life, she brings forth, and com\u00ADmands a fire to be pre\u00ADpared.

Her for\u00ADtune had been told, and it was to this ef\u00ADfect: \"At\u00ADa\u00ADlan\u00ADta, do not mar\u00ADry; mar\u00ADriage will be your ruin.\" Ter\u00ADri\u00ADfied by this or\u00ADa\u00ADcle, she fled the so\u00ADci\u00ADe\u00ADty of men, and de\u00ADvot\u00ADed her\u00ADself to the sports of the chase. To all suit\u00ADors (for she had many) she im\u00ADposed a con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion which was gen\u00ADer\u00ADal\u00ADly ef\u00ADfec\u00ADtu\u00ADal in re\u00ADliev\u00ADing her of their per\u00ADse\u00ADcu\u00ADtions,--\"I will be the prize of him who shall con\u00ADquer me in the race; but death must be the pen\u00ADal\u00ADty of all who try and fail.\" In spite of this hard con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion some would try. Hip\u00ADpom\u00ADe\u00ADnes was to be judge of the race. \"Can it be pos\u00ADsi\u00ADble that any will be so rash as to risk so much for a wife?\" said he.

All her com\u00ADpet\u00ADi\u00ADtors were dis\u00ADtanced, and were put to death with\u00ADout mer\u00ADcy.
