Thus all of us would be night\u00ADly warned in our cir\u00ADcle or min\u00ADi\u00ADa\u00ADture world if we would de\u00ADvel\u00ADop sub\u00ADjec\u00ADtive strength to re\u00ADtain the im\u00ADpres\u00ADsions left upon our dream mind. But in spite of all rea\u00ADson and con\u00ADscience-- in spite of the in\u00ADduc\u00ADtive knowl\u00ADedge re\u00ADceived through our senses-- we go on from day to day, and step by step, feed\u00ADing our soul on the lus\u00ADcious fruit of the out\u00ADward senses, un\u00ADtil the rank weeds of sefishness{sic} have choked out all oth\u00ADer forces. Thus the soul is filled with thought im\u00ADages that as\u00ADsume the form of vi\u00ADcious an\u00ADi\u00ADmals, home\u00ADly vis\u00ADaged fowls, rab\u00ADid and snarl\u00ADing cats and dogs, lep\u00ADrous and vir\u00ADile ser\u00ADpents, can\u00ADker\u00ADous liz\u00ADards, slimy in\u00ADtes\u00ADtine worms, hairy and ma\u00ADli\u00ADcious in\u00ADsects. They are gen\u00ADer\u00ADat\u00ADed by greed, envy, jeal\u00ADousy, cov\u00ADet\u00ADous\u00ADness, back\u00ADbit\u00ADing, am\u00ADo\u00ADrous long\u00ADings and oth\u00ADer im\u00ADpure thoughts. With the soul filled with this con\u00ADglom\u00ADer\u00ADa\u00ADtion of vi\u00ADrus and filth, why doubt a hell and its coun\u00ADter\u00ADpart con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion, or ex\u00ADpect the day or night to bring hap\u00ADpi\u00ADness? If evil thoughts will in\u00ADfest the soul with rav\u00ADen\u00ADous mi\u00ADcrobes, good thoughts and deeds will starve and sup\u00ADpress their ac\u00ADtiv\u00ADi\u00ADty, and cre\u00ADate a heav\u00ADen to sup\u00ADplant them. With this grand and eter\u00ADnal truth in view, man should ever think kind\u00ADly of those about him, con\u00ADtrol his tem\u00ADper in word and ac\u00ADtion, seek his own, think the best of thoughts, study to re\u00ADlieve the wor\u00ADthy poor, seek sol\u00ADace in the depth of be\u00ADing, and let gen\u00ADtle\u00ADness and meek\u00ADness char\u00ADac\u00ADter\u00ADize his life. Then will he sow the seeds of a pre\u00ADsent and fu\u00ADture heav\u00ADen. His day thoughts and his night thoughts in har\u00ADmo\u00ADny will point with un\u00ADerr\u00ADing fore\u00ADcast to a peace\u00ADful end. Spir\u00ADit\u00ADu\u00ADal and help\u00ADful warn\u00ADings will fall upon the dream mind, as gen\u00ADtly as dew upon the flow\u00ADers and as soft\u00ADly as a moth\u00ADer's kiss upon the lips of love. When our ex\u00ADter\u00ADnal lives are guid\u00ADed by the forces with\u00ADin, sweet are the words and mes\u00ADsages from our own spir\u00ADit; for those who are tru\u00ADly bless\u00ADed are those who seek di\u00ADvine love through the chan\u00ADnels of their in\u00ADner world of con\u00ADscious\u00ADness."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/357","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/358","A":[{"T":"class","d":"p6"}],"J":"\u00A0"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/359","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/360","A":[{"T":"class","d":"p4"}],"J":"{illust. cap\u00ADtion = A DI\u00ADA\u00ADGRAM GIV\u00ADING THE THE\u00ADO\u00ADRY OF THIS BOOK, AND THE RE\u00ADLA\u00ADTION\u00ADSHIP BE\u00ADTWEEN THE MI\u00ADCRO\u00ADCOSM AND THE MAC\u00ADRO\u00ADCOSM."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/361","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/362","A":[{"T":"class","d":"p4"}],"J":"FRAG\u00ADMEN\u00ADTARY THOUGHTS FROM DREAM REALMS:}"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/363","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/364","A":[{"T":"class","d":"p4"}],"J":"Man is a lit\u00ADtle cir\u00ADcle or world com\u00ADposed of the in\u00ADfin\u00ADi\u00ADtes\u00ADi\u00ADmal at\u00ADoms thrown off from the great cir\u00ADcle or par\u00ADent world, and fit\u00ADting into his place in the zone of life.
