Age\u00ADnor com\u00ADmanded his son Cad\u00ADmus to go in search of his sis\u00ADter, and not to re\u00ADturn with\u00ADout her. Cad\u00ADmus went and sought long and far for his sis\u00ADter, but could not find her, and not dar\u00ADing to re\u00ADturn un\u00ADsuc\u00ADcess\u00ADful, con\u00ADsulted the or\u00ADa\u00ADcle of Apol\u00ADlo to know what coun\u00ADtry he should set\u00ADtle in. The or\u00ADa\u00ADcle in\u00ADformed him that he should find a cow in the field, and should fol\u00ADlow her wher\u00ADev\u00ADer she might wan\u00ADder, and where she stopped, should build a city and call it Thebes. Cad\u00ADmus had hard\u00ADly left the Cas\u00ADta\u00ADli\u00ADan cave, from which the or\u00ADa\u00ADcle was de\u00ADliv\u00ADered, when he saw a young cow slow\u00ADly walk\u00ADing be\u00ADfore him. He fol\u00ADlowed her close, of\u00ADfer\u00ADing at the same time his pray\u00ADers to Phoe\u00ADbus. The cow went on till she passed the shal\u00ADlow chan\u00ADnel of Cephisus and came out into the plain of Panope. There she stood still, and rais\u00ADing her broad fore\u00ADhead to the sky, filled the air with her low\u00ADings. Cad\u00ADmus gave thanks, and stoop\u00ADing down kissed the for\u00ADeign soil, then lift\u00ADing his eyes, greeted the sur\u00ADround\u00ADing moun\u00ADtains. Wish\u00ADing to of\u00ADfer a sac\u00ADri\u00ADfice to Ju\u00ADpi\u00ADter, he sent his serv\u00ADants to seek pure wa\u00ADter for a li\u00ADba\u00ADtion. Near by there stood an an\u00ADcient grove which had nev\u00ADer been pro\u00ADfaned by the axe, in the midst of which was a cave, thick cov\u00ADered with the growth of bushes, its roof form\u00ADing a low arch, from be\u00ADneath which burst forth a foun\u00ADtain of pur\u00ADest wa\u00ADter. In the cave lurked a hor\u00ADrid ser\u00ADpent with a crest\u00ADed head and scales glit\u00ADter\u00ADing like gold. His eyes shone like fire, his body was swol\u00ADlen with ven\u00ADom, he vi\u00ADbrat\u00ADed a tri\u00ADple tongue, and showed a tri\u00ADple row of teeth. No soon\u00ADer had the Tyr\u00ADi\u00ADans dipped their pitch\u00ADers in the foun\u00ADtain, and the in- gush\u00ADing wa\u00ADters made a sound, than the glit\u00ADter\u00ADing ser\u00ADpent raised his head out of the cave and ut\u00ADtered a fear\u00ADful hiss. The ves\u00ADsels fell from their hands, the blood left their cheeks, they trembled in eve\u00ADry limb. The ser\u00ADpent, twist\u00ADing his scaly body in a huge coil, raised his head so as to over\u00ADtop the tallest trees, and while the Tyr\u00ADi\u00ADans from ter\u00ADror could nei\u00ADther fight nor fly, slew some with his fangs, oth\u00ADers in his folds, and oth\u00ADers with his poi\u00ADson\u00ADous breath."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/7","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/8","J":"Cad\u00ADmus, hav\u00ADing waited for the re\u00ADturn of his men till mid\u00ADday, went in search of them.

When he en\u00ADtered the wood, and saw the life\u00ADless bod\u00ADies of his men, and the mon\u00ADster with his bloody jaws, he ex\u00ADclaimed, \"O faith\u00ADful friends, I will avenge you, or share your death.\" So say\u00ADing he lifted a huge stone and threw it with all his force at the ser\u00ADpent. Such a block would have shak\u00ADen the wall of a for\u00ADtress, but it made no im\u00ADpres\u00ADsion on the mon\u00ADster. Cad\u00ADmus next threw his jave\u00ADlin, which met with bet\u00ADter suc\u00ADcess, for it penetrated the ser\u00ADpent's scales, and pierced through to his en\u00ADtrails. Fierce with pain, the mon\u00ADster turned back his head to view the wound, and at\u00ADtempted to draw out the weap\u00ADon with his mouth, but broke it off, leav\u00ADing the iron point rankling in his flesh. His neck swelled with rage, bloody foam cov\u00ADered his jaws, and the breath of his nos\u00ADtrils poi\u00ADsoned the air around. Now he twisted him\u00ADself into a cir\u00ADcle, then stretched him\u00ADself out on the ground like the trunk of a fall\u00ADen tree. As he moved on\u00ADward, Cad\u00ADmus re\u00ADtreated be\u00ADfore him, hold\u00ADing his spear op\u00ADpo\u00ADsite to the mon\u00ADster's opened jaws. The ser\u00ADpent snapped at the weap\u00ADon and at\u00ADtempted to bite its iron point. At last Cad\u00ADmus, watch\u00ADing his chance, thrust the spear at a mo\u00ADment when the an\u00ADi\u00ADmal's head thrown back came against the trunk of a tree, and so suc\u00ADceeded in pin\u00ADning him to its side.

He obeyed. He made a fur\u00ADrow in the ground, and planted the teeth, des\u00ADtined to pro\u00ADduce a crop of men. Scarce had he done so when the clods be\u00ADgan to move, and the points of spears to ap\u00ADpear above the sur\u00ADface.

At the be\u00ADgin\u00ADning the sky seemed to set\u00ADtle down upon the earth, and thick clouds shut in the heat\u00ADed air. For four months to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer a dead\u00ADly south wind pre\u00ADvailed. The dis\u00ADor\u00ADder af\u00ADfect\u00ADed the wells and springs; thou\u00ADsands of snakes crept over the land and shed their poi\u00ADson in the foun\u00ADtains. The force of the dis\u00ADease was first spent on the low\u00ADer an\u00ADi\u00ADmals--dogs, cat\u00ADtle, sheep, and birds The luck\u00ADless plough\u00ADman won\u00ADdered to see his oxen fall in the midst of their work, and lie help\u00ADless in the un\u00ADfin\u00ADished fur\u00ADrow. The wool fell from the bleat\u00ADing sheep, and their bod\u00ADies pined away. The horse, once fore\u00ADmost in the race, con\u00ADtested the palm no more, but groaned at his stall and died an in\u00ADglo\u00ADri\u00ADous death. The wild boar for\u00ADgot his rage, the stag his swift\u00ADness, the bears no long\u00ADer at\u00ADtacked the herds. Eve\u00ADry\u00ADthing lan\u00ADguished; dead bod\u00ADies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods; the air was poi\u00ADsoned by them, I tell you what is hard\u00ADly cred\u00ADi\u00ADble, but nei\u00ADther dogs nor birds would tou\u00ADch them, nor starv\u00ADing wolves. Their de\u00ADcay spread the in\u00ADfec\u00ADtion. Next the dis\u00ADease at\u00ADtacked the coun\u00ADtry peo\u00ADple, and then the dwell\u00ADers in the city. At first the cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with dif\u00ADfi\u00ADcul\u00ADty. The tongue grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins en\u00ADlarged and gasped for the air. Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but pre\u00ADferred to lie on the bare ground; and the ground did not cool them, but, on the con\u00ADtra\u00ADry, they heat\u00ADed the spot where they lay. Nor could the phy\u00ADsi\u00ADcians help, for the dis\u00ADease at\u00ADtacked them also, and the con\u00ADtact of the sick gave them in\u00ADfec\u00ADtion, so that the most faith\u00ADful were the first vic\u00ADtims. At last all hope of re\u00ADlief van\u00ADished, and men learn\u00ADed to look upon death as the only de\u00ADliv\u00ADer\u00ADer from dis\u00ADease. Then they gave way to eve\u00ADry in\u00ADcli\u00ADna\u00ADtion, and cared not to ask what was ex\u00ADpe\u00ADdi\u00ADent, for noth\u00ADing was ex\u00ADpe\u00ADdi\u00ADent. All re\u00ADstraint laid aside, they crowd\u00ADed around the wells and foun\u00ADtains and drank till they died, with\u00ADout quench\u00ADing thirst. Many had not strength to get away from the wa\u00ADter, but died in the midst of the stream, and oth\u00ADers would drink of it not\u00ADwith\u00ADstand\u00ADing. Such was their wea\u00ADri\u00ADness of their sick beds that some would creep forth, and if not strong enough to stand, would die on the ground. They seemed to hate their friends, and got away from their homes, as if, not know\u00ADing the cause of their sick\u00ADness, they charged it on the place of their abode. Some were seen tot\u00ADter\u00ADing along the road, as long as they could stand, while oth\u00ADers sank on the earth, and turned their dy\u00ADing eyes around to take a last look, then closed them in death."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/29","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/30","J":"\"What heart had I left me, dur\u00ADing all this, or what ought I to have had, ex\u00ADcept to hate life and wish to be with my dead sub\u00ADjects?

I went forth; I saw a mul\u00ADti\u00ADtude of men, such as I had seen in my dream, and they were pass\u00ADing in pro\u00ADces\u00ADsion in the same man\u00ADner. While I gazed with won\u00ADder and de\u00ADlight they ap\u00ADproached and kneel\u00ADing hailed me as their king. I paid my vows to Jove, and pro\u00ADceeded to al\u00ADlot the va\u00ADcant city to the new-born race, and to par\u00ADcel out the fields among them I called them Myr\u00ADmi\u00ADdons, from the ant (myrmex) from which they sprang. You have seen these per\u00ADsons; their dis\u00ADpo\u00ADsi\u00ADtions re\u00ADsem\u00ADble those which they had in their for\u00ADmer shape. They are a dil\u00ADi\u00ADgent and in\u00ADdus\u00ADtri\u00ADous race, ea\u00ADger to gain, and te\u00ADna\u00ADcious of their gains. Among them you may re\u00ADcruit your forces. They will fol\u00ADlow you to the war, young in years and bold in heart.\" This de\u00ADscrip\u00ADtion of the plague is cop\u00ADied by Ovid from the ac\u00ADcount which Thu\u00ADcyd\u00ADi\u00ADdes, the Greek his\u00ADto\u00ADri\u00ADan, gives of the plague of Ath\u00ADens. The his\u00ADto\u00ADri\u00ADan drew from life, and all the po\u00ADets and writ\u00ADers of fic\u00ADtion since his day, when they have had oc\u00ADca\u00ADsion to de\u00ADscribe a sim\u00ADi\u00ADlar scene, have bor\u00ADrowed their de\u00ADtails from him."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/33","J":"\n"}]}],"script":[]}}
