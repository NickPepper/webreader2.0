I turned my horse's flank to\u00ADward the show\u00ADer, and placed the beak of my shield over his head and neck, while I held the up\u00ADper part of it over my own neck. And thus I with\u00ADstood the show\u00ADer. And pres\u00ADent\u00ADly the sky be\u00ADcame clear, and with that, be\u00ADhold, the birds light\u00ADed upon the tree, and sang.

And when I was most charmed with lis\u00ADten\u00ADing to the birds, lo! a chiding voice was heard of one ap\u00ADproach\u00ADing me and say\u00ADing: 'O knight, what has brought thee hith\u00ADer? What evil have I done to thee that thou shouldst act to\u00ADwards me and my pos\u00ADses\u00ADsions as thou hast this day? Dost thou not know that the show\u00ADer to-day has left in my do\u00ADmin\u00ADions nei\u00ADther man nor beast alive that was ex\u00ADposed to it?'

And we charged each oth\u00ADer, and, as the on\u00ADset was fu\u00ADri\u00ADous, it was not long be\u00ADfore I was overthrown. Then the knight passed the shaft of his lance through the bri\u00ADdle-rein of my horse, and rode off with the two hors\u00ADes, leav\u00ADing me where I was. And he did not even be\u00ADstow so much no\u00ADtice upon me as to im\u00ADpris\u00ADon me, nor did he de\u00ADspoil me of my arms. So I re\u00ADturned along the road by which I had come. And when I reached the glade where the black man was, I con\u00ADfess to thee, Kay, it is a mar\u00ADvel that I did not melt down into a liq\u00ADuid pool, through the shame that I felt at the black man's de\u00ADri\u00ADsion. And that night I came to the same cas\u00ADtle where I had spent the night pre\u00ADced\u00ADing. And I was more agree\u00ADa\u00ADbly en\u00ADter\u00ADtained that night than I had been the night be\u00ADfore.
