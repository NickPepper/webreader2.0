Fa\u00ADtigued with hunt\u00ADing, when the sun got high he would seek a shady nook where a cool stream flowed, and, stretched on the grass, with his gar\u00ADments thrown aside, would en\u00ADjoy the breeze. Some\u00ADtimes he would say aloud, \"Come, sweet breeze, come and fan my breast, come and al\u00ADlay the heat that burns me.\" Some one pass\u00ADing by one day heard him talk\u00ADing in this way to the air, and, fool\u00ADish\u00ADly believing that he was talk\u00ADing to some maid\u00ADen, went and told the se\u00ADcret to Pro\u00ADcris, Ceph\u00ADa\u00ADlus's wife.
