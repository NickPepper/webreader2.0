And then they leapt from their hors\u00ADes, and drew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, so that the blood burst out in many places. Now Sir Ga\u00ADwain had this gift from a holy man, that eve\u00ADry day in the year, from morn\u00ADing to noon, his strength was in\u00ADcreased three\u00ADfold, and then it fell again to its nat\u00ADu\u00ADral meas\u00ADure. Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot was aware of this, and there\u00ADfore, dur\u00ADing the three hours that Sir Ga\u00ADwain's strength was at the height, Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot cov\u00ADered him\u00ADself with his shield, and kept his might in re\u00ADserve. And dur\u00ADing that time Sir Ga\u00ADwain gave him many sad brunts, that all the knights that looked on mar\u00ADvelled how Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot might en\u00ADdure them. Then, when it was past noon, Sir Ga\u00ADwain had only his own might; and when Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot felt him so brought down he stretched him\u00ADself up, and doubled his strokes, and gave Sir Ga\u00ADwain such a buf\u00ADfet that he fell down on his side; and Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot drew back and would strike no more. \"Why withdrawest thou, false trai\u00ADtor?\" then said Sir Ga\u00ADwain; \"now turn again and slay me, for if thou leave me thus when I am whole again, I shall do bat\u00ADtle with thee again.\" \"I shall en\u00ADdure you, sir, by God's grace,\" said Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot, \"but know thou well Sir Ga\u00ADwain, I will nev\u00ADer smite a felled knight.\" And so Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot went into the city, and Sir Ga\u00ADwain was borne into King Ar\u00ADthur's pa\u00ADvil\u00ADion, and his wounds were looked to."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/47","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/48","J":"Thus the siege en\u00ADdured, and Sir Ga\u00ADwain lay help\u00ADless near a month; and when he was near re\u00ADcov\u00ADered came tid\u00ADings unto King Ar\u00ADthur that made him re\u00ADturn with all his host to Eng\u00ADland."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/49","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/50","J":"\u00A0"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/51","J":"\n"}]}],"script":[]}}
