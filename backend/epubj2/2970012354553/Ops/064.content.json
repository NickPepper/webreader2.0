That mor\u00ADtal was Arach\u00ADne, a maid\u00ADen who had at\u00ADtained such skill in the arts of weaving and em\u00ADbroi\u00ADdery that the nymphs them\u00ADselves would leave their groves and foun\u00ADtains to come and gaze upon her work.

Each takes her sta\u00ADtion and attaches the web to the beam. Then the slen\u00ADder shut\u00ADtle is passed in and out among the threads. The reed with its fine teeth strikes up the woof into its place and com\u00ADpacts the web. Both work with speed; their skil\u00ADful hands move rap\u00ADid\u00ADly, and the ex\u00ADcite\u00ADment of the con\u00ADtest makes the la\u00ADbor light.

The in\u00ADev\u00ADi\u00ADta\u00ADble ar\u00ADrow over\u00ADtook him as he fled. Two oth\u00ADers, young\u00ADer boys, just from their tasks, had gone to the play\u00ADground to have a game of wres\u00ADtling. As they stood breast to breast, one ar\u00ADrow pierced them both. They ut\u00ADtered a cry to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer, to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer cast a part\u00ADing look around them, and to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer breathed their last. Alphenor, an el\u00ADder broth\u00ADer, see\u00ADing them fall, has\u00ADtened to the spot to ren\u00ADder as\u00ADsis\u00ADtance, and fell strick\u00ADen in the act of broth\u00ADer\u00ADly duty. One only was left, Il\u00ADi\u00ADo\u00ADne\u00ADus. He raised his arms to heav\u00ADen to try wheth\u00ADer pray\u00ADer might not avail. \"Spare me, ye gods!\" he cried, ad\u00ADdress\u00ADing all, in his ig\u00ADno\u00ADrance that all needed not his in\u00ADter\u00ADces\u00ADsions; and Apol\u00ADlo would have spared him, but the ar\u00ADrow had al\u00ADready left the string, and it was too late."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/49","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/50","J":"The ter\u00ADror of the peo\u00ADple and grief of the at\u00ADtend\u00ADants soon made Ni\u00ADo\u00ADbe ac\u00ADquaint\u00ADed with what had tak\u00ADen place. She could hard\u00ADly think it pos\u00ADsi\u00ADble; she was in\u00ADdig\u00ADnant that the gods had dared and amazed that they had been able to do it. Her hus\u00ADband, Am\u00ADphi\u00ADon, over\u00ADwhelmed with the blow, de\u00ADstroyed him\u00ADself. Alas! how dif\u00ADfer\u00ADent was this Ni\u00ADo\u00ADbe from her who had so late\u00ADly driv\u00ADen away the peo\u00ADple from the sa\u00ADcred rites, and held her state\u00ADly course through the city, the envy of her friends, now the pity even of her foes! She knelt over the life\u00ADless bod\u00ADies, and kissed now one, now an\u00ADoth\u00ADer of her dead sons. Rais\u00ADing her pal\u00ADlid arms to heav\u00ADen, \"Cru\u00ADel La\u00ADto\u00ADna,\" said she, \"feed full your rage with my an\u00ADguish!

She was brave from ex\u00ADcess of grief. The sis\u00ADters stood in gar\u00ADments of mourn\u00ADing over the biers of their dead broth\u00ADers. One fell, struck by an ar\u00ADrow, and died on the corpse she was be\u00ADwail\u00ADing. An\u00ADoth\u00ADer, at\u00ADtempt\u00ADing to con\u00ADsole her moth\u00ADer, sud\u00ADden\u00ADly ceased to speak, and sank life\u00ADless to the earth. A third tried to es\u00ADcape by flight, a fourth by con\u00ADceal\u00ADment, an\u00ADoth\u00ADer stood trembling, un\u00ADcer\u00ADtain what course to take. Six were now dead, and only one re\u00ADmained, whom the moth\u00ADer held clasped in her arms, and cov\u00ADered as it were with her whole body. \"Spare me one, and that the youngest! O spare me one of so many!\" she cried; and while she spoke, that one fell dead. Des\u00ADo\u00ADlate she sat, among sons, daugh\u00ADters, hus\u00ADband, all dead, and seemed tor\u00ADpid with grief. The breeze moved not her hair, no col\u00ADor was on her cheek, her eyes glared fixed and im\u00ADmov\u00ADa\u00ADble, there was no sign of life about her. Her very tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth, and her veins ceased to con\u00ADvey the tide of life. Her neck bent not, her arms made no ges\u00ADture, her foot no step. She was changed to stone, with\u00ADin and with\u00ADout. Yet tears con\u00ADtin\u00ADued to flow; and borne on a whirl\u00ADwind to her na\u00ADtive moun\u00ADtain, she still re\u00ADmains, a mass of rock, from which a trickling stream flows, the trib\u00ADute of her nev\u00ADer-end\u00ADing grief."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/51","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/52","J":"The sto\u00ADry of Ni\u00ADo\u00ADbe has fur\u00ADnished By\u00ADron with a fine il\u00ADlus\u00ADtra\u00ADtion of the fall\u00ADen con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion of mod\u00ADern Rome:"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/53","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/54","J":"\"The Ni\u00ADo\u00ADbe of na\u00ADtions! there she stands, Child\u00ADless and crown\u00ADless in her voice\u00ADless woe; An emp\u00ADty urn with\u00ADin her with\u00ADered hands, Whose holy dust was scat\u00ADtered long ago; The Scip\u00ADi\u00ADos' tomb con\u00ADtains no ash\u00ADes now: The very sep\u00ADul\u00ADchres lie ten\u00ADant\u00ADless Of their he\u00ADro\u00ADic dwell\u00ADers; dost thou flow, Old Ti\u00ADber! through a mar\u00ADble wil\u00ADder\u00ADness?
