Such a col\u00ADor as tinges the clouds at sun\u00ADset or at dawn came over the coun\u00ADte\u00ADnance of Di\u00ADana thus tak\u00ADen by sur\u00ADprise. Sur\u00ADrounded as she was by her nymphs, she yet turned half away, and sought with a sud\u00ADden im\u00ADpulse for her ar\u00ADrows. As they were not at hand, she dashed the wa\u00ADter into the face of the in\u00ADtrud\u00ADer, add\u00ADing these words: \"Now go and tell, if you can, that you have seen Di\u00ADana un\u00ADap\u00ADpar\u00ADelled.\" Im\u00ADme\u00ADdi\u00ADate\u00ADly a pair of branch\u00ADing stag's horns grew out of his head, his neck gained in length, his ears grew sharp-point\u00ADed, his hands be\u00ADcame feet, his arms long legs, his body was cov\u00ADered with a hairy spot\u00ADted hide. Fear took the place of his for\u00ADmer bold\u00ADness, and the hero fled. He could not but ad\u00ADmire his own speed; but when he saw his horns in the wa\u00ADter, \"Ah, wretch\u00ADed me!\" he would have said, but no sound fol\u00ADlowed the ef\u00ADfort. He groaned, and tears flowed down the face which had tak\u00ADen the place of his own. Yet his con\u00ADscious\u00ADness re\u00ADmained. What shall he do?--go home to seek the pal\u00ADace, or lie hid in the woods? The lat\u00ADter he was afraid, the for\u00ADmer he was ashamed, to do. While he hes\u00ADi\u00ADtat\u00ADed the dogs saw him. First Me\u00ADlam\u00ADpus, a Spar\u00ADtan dog, gave the sig\u00ADnal with his bark, then Pamphagus, Dorceus, Lelaps, Theron, Nape, Ti\u00ADgris, and all the rest, rushed af\u00ADter him swift\u00ADer than the wind. Over rocks and cliffs, through moun\u00ADtain gorges that seemed im\u00ADprac\u00ADti\u00ADca\u00ADble, he fled and they fol\u00ADlowed. Where he had of\u00ADten chased the stag and cheered on his pack, his pack now chased him, cheered on by his huntsmen. He longed to cry out, \"I am Ac\u00ADtae\u00ADon; rec\u00ADog\u00ADnize your mas\u00ADter!\" but the words came not at his will. The air re\u00ADsounded with the bark of the dogs. Pres\u00ADent\u00ADly one fas\u00ADtened on his back, an\u00ADoth\u00ADer seized his shoul\u00ADder. While they held their mas\u00ADter, the rest of the pack came up and bur\u00ADied their teeth in his flesh. He groaned,--not in a hu\u00ADman voice, yet cer\u00ADtain\u00ADly not in a stag's,--and fall\u00ADing on his knees, raised his eyes, and would have raised his arms in sup\u00ADpli\u00ADca\u00ADtion, if he had had them. His friends and fel\u00ADlow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and looked eve\u00ADry\u00ADwhere for Ac\u00ADtae\u00ADon, call\u00ADing on him to join the sport. At the sound of his name he turned his head, and heard them re\u00ADgret that he should be away. He ear\u00ADnest\u00ADly wished he was. He would have been well pleased to see the ex\u00ADploits of his dogs, but to feel them was too much. They were all around him, rend\u00ADing and tear\u00ADing; and it was not till they had torn his life out that the an\u00ADger of Di\u00ADana was sat\u00ADis\u00ADfied."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/61","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/62","J":"In Shel\u00ADley's poem \"Ad\u00ADo\u00ADna\u00ADis\" is the fol\u00ADlow\u00ADing al\u00ADlu\u00ADsion to the sto\u00ADry of Ac\u00ADtae\u00ADon:"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/63","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/64","J":"\"'Midst oth\u00ADers of less note came one frail form, A phan\u00ADtom among men: com\u00ADpan\u00ADion\u00ADless As the last cloud of an ex\u00ADpir\u00ADing storm, Whose thun\u00ADder is its knell; he, as I guess, Had gazed on Na\u00ADture's na\u00ADked love\u00ADli\u00ADness, Ac\u00ADtae\u00ADon-like, and now he fled astray With fee\u00ADble steps o'er the world's wil\u00ADder\u00ADness; And his own Thoughts, along that rug\u00ADged way, Pur\u00ADsued like rag\u00ADing hounds their fa\u00ADther and their prey.\""},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/65","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/66","J":"Stan\u00ADza 31."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/67","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/68","J":"The al\u00ADlu\u00ADsion is prob\u00ADa\u00ADbly to Shel\u00ADley him\u00ADself."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/69","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/70","J":"LA\u00ADTO\u00ADNA AND THE RUS\u00ADTICS"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/71","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/72","J":"Some thought the god\u00ADdess in this in\u00ADstance more se\u00ADvere than was just, while oth\u00ADers praised her con\u00ADduct as strict\u00ADly con\u00ADsist\u00ADent with her vir\u00ADgin dig\u00ADni\u00ADty.

When I was young, my fa\u00ADther, who had grown too old for ac\u00ADtive la\u00ADbors, sent me to Ly\u00ADcia to drive thence some choice oxen, and there I saw the very pond and marsh where the won\u00ADder hap\u00ADpened. Near by stood an an\u00ADcient al\u00ADtar, black with the smoke of sac\u00ADri\u00ADfice and al\u00ADmost bur\u00ADied among the reeds. I in\u00ADquired whose al\u00ADtar it might be, wheth\u00ADer of Fau\u00ADnus or the Nai\u00ADads, or some god of the neigh\u00ADbor\u00ADing moun\u00ADtain, and one of the coun\u00ADtry peo\u00ADple replied, 'No moun\u00ADtain or riv\u00ADer god possesses this al\u00ADtar, but she whom roy\u00ADal Juno in her jeal\u00ADousy drove from land to land, de\u00ADny\u00ADing her any spot of earth where\u00ADon to rear her twins. Bear\u00ADing in her arms the in\u00ADfant deities, La\u00ADto\u00ADna reached this land, wea\u00ADry with her bur\u00ADden and parched with thirst.

The god\u00ADdess ap\u00ADproached, and kneel\u00ADing on the bank would have slaked her thirst in the cool stream, but the rus\u00ADtics for\u00ADbade her. 'Why do you re\u00ADfuse me wa\u00ADter?' said she; 'wa\u00ADter is free to all. Na\u00ADture al\u00ADlows no one to claim as prop\u00ADer\u00ADty the sun\u00ADshine, the air, or the wa\u00ADter.
