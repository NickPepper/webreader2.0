And one af\u00ADter\u00ADnoon he was at Harlech, in Ardudwy, at his court; and he sat upon the rock of Harlech, look\u00ADing over the sea. And with him were his broth\u00ADer, Man\u00ADa\u00ADwyd\u00ADdan, the son of Llyr, and his broth\u00ADers by the moth\u00ADer's side, Nissyen and Ev\u00ADnis\u00ADsyen, and many no\u00ADbles like\u00ADwise, as was fit\u00ADting to see around a king. His two broth\u00ADers by the moth\u00ADer's side were the sons of Euroswydd, and one of these youths was a good youth, and of gen\u00ADtle na\u00ADture, and would make peace be\u00ADtween his kin\u00ADdred, and cause his fam\u00ADi\u00ADly to be friends when their wrath was at the highest, and this one was Nissyen; but the oth\u00ADer would cause strife be\u00ADtween his two broth\u00ADers when they were most at peace. And as they sat thus they be\u00ADheld thir\u00ADteen ships com\u00ADing from the south of Ire\u00ADland, and mak\u00ADing to\u00ADwards them; and they came with a swift mo\u00ADtion, the wind be\u00ADing be\u00ADhind them; and they neared them rap\u00ADid\u00ADly. \"I see ships afar,\" said the king, \"com\u00ADing swift\u00ADly to\u00ADwards the land.

And the men drew near, that they might hold con\u00ADverse. Then they put out boats, and came to\u00ADward the land. And they sa\u00ADlut\u00ADed the king.
