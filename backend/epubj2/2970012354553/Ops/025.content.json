Tris\u00ADtram as\u00ADsumed dif\u00ADfer\u00ADent ar\u00ADmor, that he might not be known; but he was soon de\u00ADtected by the ter\u00ADri\u00ADble blows that he gave, Ar\u00ADthur and Guenever had no doubt that it was the same knight who had borne off the prize of the day be\u00ADfore. Ar\u00ADthur's gal\u00ADlant spir\u00ADit was roused. Af\u00ADter Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot of the Lake and Sir Ga\u00ADwain he was ac\u00ADcounted the best knight of the Round Ta\u00ADble. He went pri\u00ADvate\u00ADly and armed him\u00ADself, and came into the tour\u00ADney in un\u00ADdis\u00ADtin\u00ADguished ar\u00ADmor. He ran a just with Tris\u00ADtram, whom he shook in his seat; but Tris\u00ADtram, who did not know him, threw him out of the sad\u00ADdle. Ar\u00ADthur re\u00ADcov\u00ADered him\u00ADself, and con\u00ADtent with hav\u00ADing made proof of the stran\u00ADger knight bade Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot fin\u00ADish the ad\u00ADven\u00ADture, and vin\u00ADdi\u00ADcate the hon\u00ADor of the Round Ta\u00ADble. Sir Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot, at the bid\u00ADding of the mon\u00ADarch, as\u00ADsailed Tris\u00ADtram, whose lance was al\u00ADready bro\u00ADken in for\u00ADmer en\u00ADcoun\u00ADters. But the law of this sort of com\u00ADbat was that the knight af\u00ADter hav\u00ADing bro\u00ADken his lance must fight with his sword, and must not re\u00ADfuse to meet with his shield the lance of his an\u00ADtag\u00ADo\u00ADnist. Tris\u00ADtram met Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot's charge upon his shield, which that ter\u00ADri\u00ADble lance could not fail to pierce. It in\u00ADflicted a wound upon Tris\u00ADtram's side, and, break\u00ADing, left the iron in the wound. But Tris\u00ADtram also with his sword smote so vig\u00ADor\u00ADous\u00ADly on Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot's casque that he cleft it, and wound\u00ADed his head. The wound was not deep, but the blood flowed into his eyes, and blinded him for a mo\u00ADment, and Tris\u00ADtram, who thought him\u00ADself mor\u00ADtal\u00ADly wound\u00ADed, re\u00ADtired from the field. Laun\u00ADce\u00ADlot de\u00ADclared to the king that he had nev\u00ADer re\u00ADceived such a blow in his life be\u00ADfore."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/57","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/58","J":"Tris\u00ADtram has\u00ADtened to Gouvernail, his squire, who drew forth the iron, bound up the wound, and gave him im\u00ADme\u00ADdi\u00ADate ease.
