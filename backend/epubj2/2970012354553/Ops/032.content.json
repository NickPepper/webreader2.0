Then sev\u00ADen of the knights smote upon his shield all at once, and the rem\u00ADnant slew his horse, so that he fell to the earth. So had they slain him or tak\u00ADen him, had not the good knight Sir Gal\u00ADa\u00ADhad, with the red cross, come there by ad\u00ADven\u00ADture. And when he saw all the knights upon one, he cried out, \"Save me that knight's life.\" Then he rode to\u00ADward the twen\u00ADty men of arms as fast as his horse might drive, with his spear in the rest, and smote the fore\u00ADmost horse and man to the earth. And when his spear was bro\u00ADken, he set his hand to his sword, and smote on the right hand and on the left, that it was mar\u00ADvel to see; and at eve\u00ADry stroke he smote down one, or put him to re\u00ADbuke, so that they would fight no more, but fled to a thick for\u00ADest, and Sir Gal\u00ADa\u00ADhad fol\u00ADlowed them. And when Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval saw him chase them so, he made great sor\u00ADrow that his horse was slain. And he wist well it was Sir Gal\u00ADa\u00ADhad. Then he cried aloud, \"Ah, fair knight, abide, and suf\u00ADfer me to do thanks unto thee; for right well have ye done for me.\" But Sir Gal\u00ADa\u00ADhad rode so fast that at last he passed out of his sight. When Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval saw that he would not turn, he said, \"Now am I a very wretch, and most un\u00ADhap\u00ADpy above all oth\u00ADer knights.\" So in his sor\u00ADrow he abode all that day till it was night; and then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till mid\u00ADnight; and then he awaked and saw be\u00ADfore him a wom\u00ADan, who said unto him, \"Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval, what dost thou here?\" He an\u00ADswered, \"I do nei\u00ADther good, nor great ill.\" \"If thou wilt prom\u00ADise me,\" said she, \"that thou wilt ful\u00ADfil my will when I sum\u00ADmon thee, I will lend thee my own horse, which shall bear thee whith\u00ADer thou wilt.\" Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval was glad of her prof\u00ADfer, and in\u00ADsured her to ful\u00ADfil all her de\u00ADsire. \"Then abide me here, and I will go fetch you a horse.\" And so she soon came again, and brought a horse with her that was inky black. When Per\u00ADce\u00ADval be\u00ADheld that horse he mar\u00ADvelled, it was so great and so well ap\u00ADpar\u00ADelled. And he leapt upon him and took no heed of him\u00ADself.

And when Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval came nigh the brim and saw the wa\u00ADter so bois\u00ADter\u00ADous he doubted to over\u00ADpass it. And then he made the sign of the cross on his fore\u00ADhead. When the fiend felt him so charged, he shook off Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval, and went into the wa\u00ADter cry\u00ADing and roar\u00ADing; and it seemed unto him that the wa\u00ADter burned.

And Sir Per\u00ADce\u00ADval looked forth over the sea, and saw a ship come sail\u00ADing to\u00ADwards him; and it came and stood still un\u00ADder the rock.
