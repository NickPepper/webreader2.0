Ic\u00ADa\u00ADrus, the boy, stood and looked on, some\u00ADtimes run\u00ADning to gath\u00ADer up the feath\u00ADers which the wind had blown away, and then han\u00ADdling the wax and work\u00ADing it over with his fin\u00ADgers, by his play im\u00ADped\u00ADing his fa\u00ADther in his la\u00ADbors.

He kissed the boy, not know\u00ADing that it was for the last time. Then ris\u00ADing on his wings, he flew off, en\u00ADcour\u00ADag\u00ADing him to fol\u00ADlow, and looked back from his own flight to see how his son man\u00ADaged his wings. As they flew the plough\u00ADman stopped his work to gaze, and the shep\u00ADherd leaned on his staff and watched them, aston\u00ADished at the sight, and think\u00ADing they were gods who could thus cleave the air."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/45","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/46","J":"They passed Sa\u00ADmos and De\u00ADlos on the left and Lebynthos on the right, when the boy, ex\u00ADult\u00ADing in his ca\u00ADreer, be\u00ADgan to leave the guid\u00ADance of his com\u00ADpan\u00ADion and soar up\u00ADward as if to reach heav\u00ADen.
