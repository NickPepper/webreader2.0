Then King Ar\u00ADthur saw where Sir Mo\u00ADdred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men. \"Now give me my spear,\" said Ar\u00ADthur unto Sir Lu\u00ADcan; \"for yon\u00ADder I espy the trai\u00ADtor that hast wrought all this woe.\" \"Sir, let him be,\" said Sir Lu\u00ADcan; \"for if ye pass this un\u00ADhap\u00ADpy day, ye shall be right well re\u00ADvenged upon him.

And when Sir Mo\u00ADdred felt that he had his death-wound, with the might that he had he smote King Ar\u00ADthur, with his sword hold\u00ADen in both his hands, on the side of the head, that the sword pierced the hel\u00ADmet and the brain-pan; and then Sir Mo\u00ADdred fell stark dead upon the earth. And the no\u00ADble Ar\u00ADthur fell in a swoon to the earth. And Sir Lu\u00ADcan, the but\u00ADler, and Sir Bed\u00ADi\u00ADvere raised him up, and gen\u00ADtly led him be\u00ADtwixt them both to a lit\u00ADtle chap\u00ADel not far from the sea-side. And when the king was there he thought him well eased. Then heard they peo\u00ADple cry in the field. And Sir Lu\u00ADcan went to see what that cry be\u00ADto\u00ADkened; and he saw by the moon\u00ADlight that pillers and rob\u00ADbers were come to rob the dead. And he re\u00ADturned, and said to the king, \"By my rede, it is best that we bring you to some town.\" \"I would it were so,\" said the king. And when the king tried to go he fainted. Then Sir Lu\u00ADcan took up the king on the one part, and Sir Bed\u00ADi\u00ADvere on the oth\u00ADer part; and in the lift\u00ADing, Sir Lu\u00ADcan fell in a swoon to the earth, for he was griev\u00ADous\u00ADly wound\u00ADed. And then the no\u00ADble knight's heart burst. And when the king awoke he be\u00ADheld Sir Lu\u00ADcan how he lay foam\u00ADing at the mouth, and speech\u00ADless. \"Alas!\" said the king, \"this is to me a full heavy sight, to see this no\u00ADble duke so die for my sake; for he would have hol\u00ADpen me that had more need of help than I, and he would not com\u00ADplain, his heart was so set to help me.\" Then Sir Bed\u00ADi\u00ADvere wept for his broth\u00ADer. \"Leave this mourn\u00ADing and weep\u00ADing,\" said the king, \"for wilt thou well, if I might live my\u00ADself, the death of Sir Lu\u00ADcan would grieve me ev\u00ADer\u00ADmore; but my time hieth fast.
