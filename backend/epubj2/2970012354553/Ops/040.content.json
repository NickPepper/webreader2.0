And there was the Knight of the Spar\u00ADrow- hawk mak\u00ADing the proc\u00ADla\u00ADma\u00ADtion, and ask\u00ADing his lady-love to take the spar\u00ADrow-hawk. \"Take it not,\" said Ge\u00ADraint, \"for here is a maid\u00ADen who is fairer, and more no\u00ADble, and more come\u00ADly, and who has a bet\u00ADter claim to it than thou.\" Then said the knight, \"If thou maintainest the spar\u00ADrow-hawk to be due to her, come for\u00ADward and do bat\u00ADtle with me.\" And Ge\u00ADraint went for\u00ADward to the top of the mead\u00ADow, hav\u00ADing upon him\u00ADself and upon his horse ar\u00ADmor which was heavy and rusty, and of un\u00ADcouth shape. Then they en\u00ADcoun\u00ADtered each oth\u00ADer, and they broke a set of lances; and they broke a se\u00ADcond set, and a third. And when the earl and his com\u00ADpa\u00ADny saw the Knight of the Spar\u00ADrow-hawk gain\u00ADing the mas\u00ADtery, there was shout\u00ADing and joy and mirth amongst them; and the hoary-head\u00ADed man and his wife and his daugh\u00ADter were sorrowful. And the hoary-head\u00ADed man served Ge\u00ADraint with lances as of\u00ADten as he broke them, and the dwarf served the Knight of the Spar\u00ADrow-hawk. Then the hoary-head\u00ADed man said to Ge\u00ADraint, \"O chief\u00ADtain, since no oth\u00ADer will hold with thee, be\u00ADhold, here is the lance which was in my hand on the day when I re\u00ADceived the hon\u00ADor of knight\u00ADhood, and from that time to this I nev\u00ADer broke it, and it has an ex\u00ADcel\u00ADlent point.\" Then Ge\u00ADraint took the lance, thank\u00ADing the hoary-head\u00ADed man. And there\u00ADup\u00ADon the dwarf also brought a lance to his lord. \"Be\u00ADhold, here is a lance for thee, not less good than his,\" said the dwarf. \"And be\u00ADthink thee that no knight ever with\u00ADstood thee so long as this one has done.\" \"I de\u00ADclare to Heav\u00ADen,\" said Ge\u00ADraint, \"that un\u00ADless death takes me quick\u00ADly hence, he shall fare nev\u00ADer the bet\u00ADter for thy ser\u00ADvice.\" And Ge\u00ADraint pricked his horse to\u00ADwards him from afar, and, warn\u00ADing him, he rushed upon him, and gave him a blow so se\u00ADvere, and fu\u00ADri\u00ADous, and fierce, upon the face of his shield, that he cleft it in two, and broke his ar\u00ADmor, and burst his girths, so that both he and his sad\u00ADdle were borne to the ground over the horse's crup\u00ADper. And Ge\u00ADraint dis\u00ADmounted quick\u00ADly. And he was wroth, and he drew his sword, and rushed fierce\u00ADly upon him. Then the knight also arose, and drew his sword against Ge\u00ADraint. And they fought on foot with their swords un\u00ADtil their arms struck sparks of fire like stars from one an\u00ADoth\u00ADer; and thus they con\u00ADtin\u00ADued fight\u00ADing un\u00ADtil the blood and sweat obscured the light from their eyes. At length Ge\u00ADraint called to him all his strength, and struck the knight upon the crown of his head, so that he broke all his head-ar\u00ADmor, and cut through all the flesh and the skin, even to the skull, un\u00ADtil he wound\u00ADed the bone."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/49","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/50","J":"Then the knight fell upon his knees, and cast his sword from his hand, and be\u00ADsought mer\u00ADcy from Ge\u00ADraint. \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"I re\u00ADlin\u00ADquish my overdaring and my pride, and crave thy mer\u00ADcy; and un\u00ADless I have time to com\u00ADmit my\u00ADself to Heav\u00ADen for my sins, and to talk with a priest, thy mer\u00ADcy will avail me lit\u00ADtle.\" \"I will grant thee grace upon this con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion,\" said Ge\u00ADraint, \"that thou go to Guenever, the wife of Ar\u00ADthur, to do her sat\u00ADis\u00ADfac\u00ADtion for the in\u00ADsult which her maid\u00ADen re\u00ADceived from thy dwarf.
