And as he rode he came to a place where he saw two knights in bat\u00ADtle, and one of them had got\u00ADten the bet\u00ADter and the oth\u00ADer lay overthrown. The knight who had the bet\u00ADter was Sir Palamedes. When Sir Palamedes knew Sir Tris\u00ADtram, he cried out, \"Sir Tris\u00ADtram, now we be met, and ere we de\u00ADpart we will re\u00ADdress our old wrongs.\" \"As for that,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"there nev\u00ADer yet was Chris\u00ADtian man that might make his boast that I ever fled from him, and thou that art a Sar\u00ADa\u00ADcen shalt nev\u00ADer say that of me.\" And there\u00ADwith Sir Tris\u00ADtram made his horse to run, and with all his might came straight upon Sir Palamedes, and broke his spear upon him. Then he drew his sword and struck at Sir Palamedes six great strokes, upon his helm. Sir Palamedes saw that Sir Tris\u00ADtram had not his ar\u00ADmor on, and he mar\u00ADvelled at his rashness and his great fol\u00ADly; and said to him\u00ADself, \"If I meet and slay him, I am shamed where\u00ADso\u00ADev\u00ADer I go.\" Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram cried out and said, \"Thou cow\u00ADard knight, why wilt thou not do bat\u00ADtle with me? for have thou no doubt I shall en\u00ADdure all thy mal\u00ADice.\" \"Ah, Sir Tris\u00ADtram!\" said Sir Palamedes, \"thou knowest I may not fight with thee for shame; for thou art here na\u00ADked, and I am armed; now I re\u00ADquire that thou an\u00ADswer me a ques\u00ADtion that I shall ask you.\" \"Tell me what it is,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram. \"I put the case,\" said Palamedes, \"that you were well armed, and I na\u00ADked as ye be; what would you do to me now, by your true knight\u00ADhood?\" \"Ah!\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"now I un\u00ADder\u00ADstand thee well, Sir Palamedes; and, as God bless me, what I shall say shall not be said for fear that I have of thee. But if it were so, thou should\u00ADest de\u00ADpart from me, for I would not have to do with thee.\" \"No more will I with thee,\" said Sir Palamedes, \"and there\u00ADfore ride forth on thy way.\" \"As for that, I may choose,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"ei\u00ADther to ride or to abide. But, Sir Palamedes, I mar\u00ADvel at one thing,--that thou art so good a knight, yet that thou wilt not be chris\u00ADtened.\" \"As for that,\" said Sir Palamedes, \"I may not yet be chris\u00ADtened, for a vow which I made many years ago; yet in my heart I be\u00ADlieve in our Sav\u00ADiour and his mild moth\u00ADer, Mary; but I have yet one bat\u00ADtle to do, and when that is done I will be chris\u00ADtened, with a good will.\" \"By my head,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"as for that one bat\u00ADtle, thou shalt seek it no long\u00ADer; for yon\u00ADder is a knight, whom you have smit\u00ADten down. Now help me to be clothed in his ar\u00ADmor, and I will soon ful\u00ADfil thy vow.\" \"As ye will,\" said Sir Palamedes, \"so shall it be.\" So they rode both unto that knight that sat on a bank; and Sir Tris\u00ADtram sa\u00ADlut\u00ADed him, and he full wea\u00ADry sa\u00ADlut\u00ADed him again. \"Sir,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"I pray you to lend me your whole ar\u00ADmor; for I am un\u00ADarmed, and I must do bat\u00ADtle with this knight.\" \"Sir,\" said the hurt knight, \"you shall have it, with a right good will,\" Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram un\u00ADarmed Sir Galleron, for that was the name of the hurt knight, and he as well as he could helped to arm Sir Tris\u00ADtram. Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram mount\u00ADed upon his own horse, and in his hand he took Sir Galleron's spear. There\u00ADup\u00ADon Sir Palamedes was ready, and so they came hurl\u00ADing to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer, and each smote the oth\u00ADer in the midst of their shields. Sir Palamedes' spear broke, and Sir Tris\u00ADtram smote down the horse. Then Sir Palamedes leapt from his horse, and drew out his sword. That saw Sir Tris\u00ADtram, and there\u00ADwith he alight\u00ADed and tied his horse to a tree. Then they came to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer as two wild beasts, lash\u00ADing the one on the oth\u00ADer, and so fought more than two hours; and of\u00ADten Sir Tris\u00ADtram smote such strokes at Sir Palamedes that he made him to kneel, and Sir Palamedes broke away Sir Tris\u00ADtram's shield, and wound\u00ADed him. Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram was wroth out of meas\u00ADure, and he rushed to Sir Palamedes and wound\u00ADed him pass\u00ADing sore through the shoul\u00ADder, and by for\u00ADtune smote Sir Palamedes' sword out of his hand And if Sir Palamedes had stooped for his sword Sir Tris\u00ADtram had slain him. Then Sir Palamedes stood and be\u00ADheld his sword with a full sorrowful heart. \"Now,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"I have thee at a van\u00ADtage, as thou hadst me to-day; but it shall nev\u00ADer be said, in court, or among good knights, that Sir Tris\u00ADtram did slay any knight that was weap\u00ADon\u00ADless; there\u00ADfore take thou thy sword, and let us fight this bat\u00ADtle to the end.\" Then spoke Sir Palamedes to Sir Tris\u00ADtram: \"I have no wish to fight this bat\u00ADtle any more. The of\u00ADfence that I have done unto you is not so great but that, if it please you, we may be friends. All that I have of\u00ADfended is for the love of the queen, La Belle Isoude, and I dare main\u00ADtain that she is peer\u00ADless among la\u00ADdies; and for that of\u00ADfence ye have giv\u00ADen me many griev\u00ADous and sad strokes, and some I have giv\u00ADen you again. Where\u00ADfore I re\u00ADquire you, my lord Sir Tris\u00ADtram, for\u00ADgive me all that I have of\u00ADfended you, and this day have me unto the next church; and first I will be clean con\u00ADfessed, and af\u00ADter that see you that I be tru\u00ADly bap\u00ADtized, and then we will ride to\u00ADgeth\u00ADer unto the court of my lord, King Ar\u00ADthur, so that we may be there at the feast of Pen\u00ADte\u00ADcost.\" \"Now take your horse,\" said Sir Tris\u00ADtram, \"and as you have said, so shall it be done.\" So they took their hors\u00ADes, and Sir Galleron rode with them. When they came to the church of Car\u00ADlisle, the bish\u00ADop com\u00ADmanded to fill a great ves\u00ADsel with wa\u00ADter; and when he had hal\u00ADlowed it, he then con\u00ADfessed Sir Palamedes clean, and chris\u00ADtened him, and Sir Tris\u00ADtram and Sir Galleron were his god\u00ADfa\u00ADthers. Then soon af\u00ADter they de\u00ADpart\u00ADed, and rode to\u00ADwards Cam\u00ADe\u00ADlot, where the no\u00ADble King Ar\u00ADthur and Queen Guenever were keep\u00ADing a court roy\u00ADal. And the king and all the court were glad that Sir Palamedes was chris\u00ADtened. Then Sir Tris\u00ADtram re\u00ADturned again to La Joyeuse Garde, and Sir Palamedes went his way."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/7","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/8","J":"Not long af\u00ADter these events Sir Ga\u00ADwain re\u00ADturned from Brit\u00ADta\u00ADny, and re\u00ADlat\u00ADed to King Ar\u00ADthur the ad\u00ADven\u00ADture which be\u00ADfell him in the for\u00ADest of Breciliande, how Mer\u00ADlin had there spo\u00ADken to him, and en\u00ADjoined him to charge the king to go with\u00ADout de\u00ADlay upon the quest of the Holy Greal.
