He was ig\u00ADno\u00ADrant who his fa\u00ADther was, till it was dis\u00ADcov\u00ADered in the fol\u00ADlow\u00ADing man\u00ADner: When the youth was of prop\u00ADer years to re\u00ADceive the hon\u00ADors of knight\u00ADhood, King Ar\u00ADthur held a grand court for the pur\u00ADpose of knight\u00ADing him. On this oc\u00ADca\u00ADsion a strange knight pre\u00ADsented him\u00ADself, and chal\u00ADlenged the knights of Ar\u00ADthur's court to ex\u00ADchange blow for blow with him. His pro\u00ADpo\u00ADsal was this--to lay his neck on a block for any knight to strike, on con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion that, if he sur\u00ADvived the blow, the knight should sub\u00ADmit in turn to the same ex\u00ADper\u00ADi\u00ADment. Sir Kay, who was usu\u00ADal\u00ADly ready to ac\u00ADcept all chal\u00ADlenges, pro\u00ADnounced this whol\u00ADly un\u00ADrea\u00ADson\u00ADa\u00ADble, and de\u00ADclared that he would not ac\u00ADcept it for all the wealth in the world. And when the knight of\u00ADfered his sword, with which the op\u00ADer\u00ADa\u00ADtion was to be per\u00ADformed, no per\u00ADson ven\u00ADtured to ac\u00ADcept it, till Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc, grow\u00ADing an\u00ADgry at the dis\u00ADgrace which was thus in\u00ADcurred by the Round Ta\u00ADble, threw aside his man\u00ADtle and took it. \"Do you do this as one of the best knights?\" said the stran\u00ADger. \"No,\" he replied, \"but as one of the most fool\u00ADish.\" The stran\u00ADger lays his head upon the block, re\u00ADceives a blow which sends it roll\u00ADing from his shoul\u00ADders, walks af\u00ADter it, picks it up, re\u00ADplaces it with great suc\u00ADcess, and says he will re\u00ADturn when the court shall be as\u00ADsem\u00ADbled next year, and claim his turn. When the an\u00ADni\u00ADver\u00ADsa\u00ADry ar\u00ADrived, both parties were punc\u00ADtu\u00ADal to their en\u00ADgage\u00ADment. Great en\u00ADtreat\u00ADies were used by the king and queen, and the whole court, in be\u00ADhalf of Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc, but the stran\u00ADger was in\u00ADflex\u00ADi\u00ADble. The young knight laid his head upon the block, and more than once de\u00ADsired him to make an end of the busi\u00ADness, and not keep him long\u00ADer in so dis\u00ADa\u00ADgree\u00ADa\u00ADble a state of ex\u00ADpec\u00ADta\u00ADtion. At last the stran\u00ADger strikes him gen\u00ADtly with the side of the sword, bids him rise, and re\u00ADveals to him the fact that he is his fa\u00ADther, the en\u00ADchant\u00ADer Eliaures, and that he glad\u00ADly owns him for a son, hav\u00ADing proved his cour\u00ADage and fi\u00ADdel\u00ADi\u00ADty to his word."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/7","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/8","J":"But the fa\u00ADvor of en\u00ADchant\u00ADers is short-lived and un\u00ADcer\u00ADtain.

As soon as they were in\u00ADformed of his de\u00ADplor\u00ADa\u00ADble con\u00ADdi\u00ADtion, they set out for Nantes, where Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc's cas\u00ADtle was, that Guimier might at\u00ADtend upon him. When Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc heard of their com\u00ADing, his first emo\u00ADtion was that of joy and love. But soon he be\u00ADgan to fear that the sight of his ema\u00ADci\u00ADat\u00ADed form, and of his suf\u00ADfer\u00ADings, would dis\u00ADgust Guimier; and this ap\u00ADpre\u00ADhen\u00ADsion be\u00ADcame so strong, that he de\u00ADpart\u00ADed se\u00ADcret\u00ADly from Nantes, and hid him\u00ADself in a her\u00ADmit\u00ADage. He was sought far and near by the knights of Ar\u00ADthur's court, and Cador made a vow nev\u00ADer to de\u00ADsist from the quest till he should have found him. Af\u00ADter long wan\u00ADder\u00ADing, Cador dis\u00ADcov\u00ADered his friend in the her\u00ADmit\u00ADage, re\u00ADduced al\u00ADmost to a skel\u00ADe\u00ADton, and ap\u00ADpar\u00ADent\u00ADly near his death. All oth\u00ADer means of re\u00ADlief hav\u00ADing al\u00ADready been tried in vain, Cador at last pre\u00ADvailed on the en\u00ADchant\u00ADer Eliaures to dis\u00ADclose the only meth\u00ADod which could avail for his res\u00ADcue. A maid\u00ADen must be found, his equal in birth and beau\u00ADty, and lov\u00ADing him bet\u00ADter than her\u00ADself, so that she would ex\u00ADpose her\u00ADself to the same tor\u00ADment to de\u00ADliv\u00ADer him. Two ves\u00ADsels were then to be pro\u00ADvid\u00ADed, the one filled with sour wine, and the oth\u00ADer with milk. Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc must en\u00ADter the first, so that the wine should reach his neck, and the maid\u00ADen must get into the oth\u00ADer, and, ex\u00ADpos\u00ADing her bos\u00ADom upon the edge of the ves\u00ADsel, in\u00ADvite the ser\u00ADpent to for\u00ADsake the with\u00ADered flesh of his vic\u00ADtim for this fresh and in\u00ADvit\u00ADing food. The ves\u00ADsels were to be placed three feet apart, and as the ser\u00ADpent crossed from one to the oth\u00ADer. a knight was to cut him in two. If he failed in his blow, Ca\u00ADrad\u00ADoc would in\u00ADdeed be de\u00ADliv\u00ADered, but it would be only to see his fair cham\u00ADpi\u00ADon suf\u00ADfer\u00ADing the same cru\u00ADel and hope\u00ADless tor\u00ADment.
