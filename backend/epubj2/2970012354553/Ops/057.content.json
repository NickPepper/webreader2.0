But it was all un\u00ADa\u00ADvail\u00ADing.

It was where now stands the city of Eleu\u00ADsis, then the home of an old man named Celeus. He was out in the field, gath\u00ADer\u00ADing acorns and blackberries, and sticks for his fire. His lit\u00ADtle girl was driv\u00ADing home their two goats, and as she passed the god\u00ADdess, who ap\u00ADpeared in the guise of an old wom\u00ADan, she said to her, \"Moth\u00ADer,\"--and the name was sweet to the ears of Ce\u00ADres,-- \"why do you sit here alone upon the rocks?\" The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and begged her to come into his cot\u00ADtage, such as it was. She de\u00ADclined, and he urged her. \"Go in peace,\" she replied, \"and be hap\u00ADpy in your daugh\u00ADter; I have lost mine.\" As she spoke, tears--or some\u00ADthing like tears, for the gods nev\u00ADer weep--fell down her cheeks upon her bos\u00ADom. The com\u00ADpas\u00ADsion\u00ADate old man and his child wept with her. Then said he, \"Come with us, and de\u00ADspise not our hum\u00ADble roof; so may your daugh\u00ADter be re\u00ADstored to you in safe\u00ADty.\" \"Lead on,\" said she, \"I can\u00ADnot re\u00ADsist that ap\u00ADpeal!\" So she rose from the stone and went with them. As they walked he told her that his only son, a lit\u00ADtle boy, lay very sick, fe\u00ADver\u00ADish, and sleep\u00ADless. She stooped and gath\u00ADered some poppies. As they en\u00ADtered the cot\u00ADtage, they found all in great dis\u00ADtress, for the boy seemed past hope of re\u00ADcov\u00ADery. Met\u00ADa\u00ADni\u00ADra, his moth\u00ADer, re\u00ADceived her kind\u00ADly, and the god\u00ADdess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child. In\u00ADstant\u00ADly the paleness left his face, and healthy vig\u00ADor re\u00ADturned to his body. The whole fam\u00ADi\u00ADly were de\u00ADlight\u00ADed--that is, the fa\u00ADther, moth\u00ADer, and lit\u00ADtle girl, for they were all; they had no serv\u00ADants. They spread the ta\u00ADble, and put upon it curds and cream, ap\u00ADples, and hon\u00ADey in the comb. While they ate, Ce\u00ADres mingled pop\u00ADpy juice in the milk of the boy. When night came and all was still, she arose, and tak\u00ADing the sleep\u00ADing boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and ut\u00ADtered over him three times a sol\u00ADemn charm, then went and laid him in the ash\u00ADes. His moth\u00ADer, who had been watch\u00ADing what her guest was do\u00ADing, sprang for\u00ADward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire.

Ce\u00ADres, see\u00ADing this, was no long\u00ADer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause, and laid the blame on the in\u00ADno\u00ADcent land. \"Un\u00ADgrate\u00ADful soil,\" said she, \"which I have en\u00ADdowed with fer\u00ADtil\u00ADi\u00ADty and clothed with herb\u00ADage and nour\u00ADish\u00ADing grain, no more shall you en\u00ADjoy my fa\u00ADvors.\" Then the cat\u00ADtle died, the plough broke in the fur\u00ADrow, the seed failed to come up; there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the seeds--this\u00ADtles and bram\u00ADbles were the only growth. See\u00ADing this, the foun\u00ADtain Ar\u00ADe\u00ADthu\u00ADsa in\u00ADter\u00ADced\u00ADed for the land. \"God\u00ADdess,\" said she, \"blame not the land; it opened un\u00ADwill\u00ADing\u00ADly to yield a pas\u00ADsage to your daugh\u00ADter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her. This is not my na\u00ADtive coun\u00ADtry; I came hith\u00ADer from Elis. I was a wood\u00ADland nymph, and de\u00ADlight\u00ADed in the chase.

The wil\u00ADlows shad\u00ADed it, and the grassy bank sloped down to the wa\u00ADter's edge. I ap\u00ADproached, I touched the wa\u00ADter with my foot.

While I sported in the wa\u00ADter, I heard an in\u00ADdis\u00ADtinct mur\u00ADmur com\u00ADing up as out of the depths of the stream: and made haste to es\u00ADcape to the nearest bank. The voice said, 'Why do you fly, Ar\u00ADe\u00ADthu\u00ADsa? I am Al\u00ADphe\u00ADus, the god of this stream.' I ran, he pur\u00ADsued; he was not more swift than I, but he was stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed. At last, ex\u00ADhausted, I cried for help to Di\u00ADana. 'Help me, god\u00ADdess! help your vo\u00ADta\u00ADry!' The god\u00ADdess heard, and wrapped me sud\u00ADden\u00ADly in a thick cloud.

Oh, how I trembled,--like a lamb that hears the wolf growl\u00ADing out\u00ADside the fold. A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in streams; where my foot stood there was a pool. In short, in less time than it takes to tell it I be\u00ADcame a foun\u00ADtain. But in this form Al\u00ADphe\u00ADus knew me and at\u00ADtempted to min\u00ADgle his stream with mine.

One day he had drawn his nets to land, and had tak\u00ADen a great many fish\u00ADes of var\u00ADi\u00ADous kinds. So he emp\u00ADtied his net, and pro\u00ADceeded to sort the fish\u00ADes on the grass. The place where he stood was a beau\u00ADti\u00ADful is\u00ADland in the riv\u00ADer, a sol\u00ADi\u00ADtary spot, un\u00ADin\u00ADhab\u00ADit\u00ADed, and not used for pas\u00ADtur\u00ADage of cat\u00ADtle, nor ever vis\u00ADited by any but him\u00ADself.

He did not know what to make of this, wheth\u00ADer some god had done it or some se\u00ADcret pow\u00ADer in the herb\u00ADage. \"What herb has such a pow\u00ADer?\" he ex\u00ADclaimed; and gath\u00ADer\u00ADing some of it, he tast\u00ADed it. Scarce had the juices of the plant reached his pal\u00ADate when he found him\u00ADself ag\u00ADi\u00ADtat\u00ADed with a long\u00ADing de\u00ADsire for the wa\u00ADter.

When he re\u00ADcov\u00ADered, he found him\u00ADself changed in form and mind. His hair was sea-green, and trailed be\u00ADhind him on the wa\u00ADter; his shoul\u00ADders grew broad, and what had been thighs and legs as\u00ADsumed the form of a fish's tail.
