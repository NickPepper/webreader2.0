And af\u00ADter the first meal Pwyll arose to walk; and he went to the top of a mound that was above the pal\u00ADace, and was called Gor\u00ADsedd Arberth. \"Lord,\" said one of the court, \"it is pe\u00ADcu\u00ADli\u00ADar to the mound that who\u00ADso\u00ADev\u00ADer sits upon it can\u00ADnot go thence with\u00ADout ei\u00ADther re\u00ADceiv\u00ADing wounds or blows, or else see\u00ADing a won\u00ADder.\" \"I fear not to re\u00ADceive wounds or blows,\" said Pwyll; \"but as to the won\u00ADder, glad\u00ADly would I see it.

And while he sat there, they saw a lady, on a pure white horse of large size, with a gar\u00ADment of shin\u00ADing gold around her, com\u00ADing along the high\u00ADway that led from the mound. \"My men,\" said Pwyll, \"is there any among you who knows yon\u00ADder lady?\" \"There is not, lord,\" said they. \"Go one of you and meet her, that we may know who she is.\" And one of them arose, and as he came upon the road to meet her, she passed by; and he fol\u00ADlowed as fast as he could, be\u00ADing on foot, and the great\u00ADer was his speed, the fur\u00ADther was she from him. And when he saw that it prof\u00ADited him noth\u00ADing to fol\u00ADlow her, he re\u00ADturned to Pwyll, and said unto him, \"Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to fol\u00ADlow her on foot.\" \"Ver\u00ADi\u00ADly,\" said Pwyll, \"go unto the pal\u00ADace, and take the fleetest horse that thou seest, and go af\u00ADter her.\""},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/9","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/10","J":"And he took a horse and went for\u00ADward. And he came to an open, lev\u00ADel plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse, the fur\u00ADther was she from him. And he re\u00ADturned to the place where Pwyll was, and said, \"Lord, it will avail noth\u00ADing for any one to fol\u00ADlow yon\u00ADder lady. I know of no horse in these realms swift\u00ADer than this, and it availed me not to pur\u00ADsue her.\" \"Of a truth,\" said Pwyll, \"there must be some il\u00ADlu\u00ADsion here; let us go to\u00ADwards the pal\u00ADace.\" So to the pal\u00ADace they went, and spent the day."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/11","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/12","J":"And the next day they amused them\u00ADselves un\u00ADtil it was time to go to meat. And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, \"Where are the hosts that went yes\u00ADter\u00ADday to the top of the mound?\" \"Be\u00ADhold, lord, we are here,\" said they. \"Let us go,\" said he, \"to the mound, and sit there. And do thou,\" said he to the page who tended his horse, \"sad\u00ADdle my horse well, and has\u00ADten with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with thee.\" And the youth did thus. And they went and sat upon the mound; and ere they had been there but a short time, they be\u00ADheld the lady com\u00ADing by the same road, and in the same man\u00ADner, and at the same pace. \"Young man,\" said Pwyll, \"I see the lady com\u00ADing; give me my horse.\" And be\u00ADfore he had mount\u00ADed his horse she passed him. And he turned af\u00ADter her and fol\u00ADlowed her. And he let his horse go bound\u00ADing play\u00ADful\u00ADly, and thought that he should soon come up with her. But he came no nearer to her than at first. Then he urged his horse to his ut\u00ADmost speed, yet he found that it availed not. Then said Pwyll, \"O maid\u00ADen, for the sake of him whom thou best lovest, stay for me.\" \"I will stay glad\u00ADly,\" said she; \"and it were bet\u00ADter for thy horse hadst thou asked it long since.\" So the maid\u00ADen stopped; and she threw back that part of her head-dress which cov\u00ADered her face. Then he thought that the beau\u00ADty of all the maid\u00ADens and all the la\u00ADdies that he had ever seen was as noth\u00ADing com\u00ADpared to her beau\u00ADty. \"Lady,\" he said, \"wilt thou tell me aught con\u00ADcern\u00ADing thy pur\u00ADpose?\" \"I will tell thee,\" said she; \"my chief quest was to see thee.\" \"Tru\u00ADly,\" said Pwyll, \"this is to me the most pleas\u00ADing quest on which thou couldst have come; and wilt thou tell me who thou art?\" \"I will tell thee, lord,\" said she. \"I am Rhi\u00ADan\u00ADnon, the daugh\u00ADter of Heveydd, and they sought to give me a hus\u00ADband against my will. But no hus\u00ADband would I have, and that be\u00ADcause of my love for thee; nei\u00ADther will I yet have one, un\u00ADless thou re\u00ADject me; and hith\u00ADer have I come to hear thy an\u00ADswer.\" \"By Heav\u00ADen,\" said Pwyll, \"be\u00ADhold this is my an\u00ADswer. If I might choose among all the la\u00ADdies and dam\u00ADsels in the world, thee would I choose.\" \"Ver\u00ADi\u00ADly,\" said she, \"if thou art thus mind\u00ADed, make a pledge to meet me ere I am giv\u00ADen to an\u00ADoth\u00ADer.\" \"The soon\u00ADer I may do so, the more pleas\u00ADing will it be to me,\" said Pwyll; \"and where\u00ADso\u00ADev\u00ADer thou wilt, there will I meet with thee.\" \"I will that thou meet me this day twelve\u00ADmonth at the pal\u00ADace of Heveydd.\" \"Glad\u00ADly,\" said he, \"will I keep this tryst.\" So they part\u00ADed, and he went back to his hosts, and to them of his house\u00ADhold. And what\u00ADso\u00ADev\u00ADer ques\u00ADtions they asked him re\u00ADspect\u00ADing the dam\u00ADsel, he al\u00ADways turned the dis\u00ADcourse upon oth\u00ADer mat\u00ADters."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/13","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/14","J":"And when a year from that time was gone, he caused a hun\u00ADdred knights to equip them\u00ADselves, and to go with him to the pal\u00ADace of Heveydd.

Then Gawl, the son of Clud, set out to the feast that was pre\u00ADpared for him; and he came to the pal\u00ADace, and was re\u00ADceived there with re\u00ADjoic\u00ADing. Pwyll, also, the chief of Dyved, came to the or\u00ADchard with a hun\u00ADdred knights, as Rhi\u00ADan\u00ADnon had com\u00ADmanded him. And Pwyll was clad in coarse and rag\u00ADged gar\u00ADments, and wore large, clum\u00ADsy old shoes upon his feet. And when he knew that the ca\u00ADrous\u00ADal af\u00ADter the meat had be\u00ADgun, he went to\u00ADward the hall; and when he came into the hall he sa\u00ADlut\u00ADed Gawl, the son of Clud, and his com\u00ADpa\u00ADny, both men and wom\u00ADen. \"Heav\u00ADen pros\u00ADper thee,\" said Gawl, \"and friend\u00ADly greet\u00ADing be unto thee!\" \"Lord,\" said he, \"may Heav\u00ADen re\u00ADward thee!

Br\u00ADing him food.\" A great num\u00ADber of at\u00ADtend\u00ADants arose and be\u00ADgan to fill the bag; but for all they put into it, it was no full\u00ADer than at first. \"My soul,\" said Gawl, \"will thy bag ever be full?\" \"It will not, I de\u00ADclare to Heav\u00ADen,\" said he, \"for all that may be put into it, un\u00ADless one pos\u00ADsessed of lands, and do\u00ADmains, and treas\u00ADure, shall arise and tread down with both his feet the food that is with\u00ADin the bag, and shall say, 'Enough has been put there\u00ADin.'\" Then said Rhi\u00ADan\u00ADnon unto Gawl, the son of Clud, \"Rise up quick\u00ADly.\" \"I will will\u00ADing\u00ADly arise,\" said he. So he rose up, and put his two feet into the bag. And Pwyll turned up the sides of the bag, so that Gawl was over his head in it. And he shut it up quick\u00ADly, and slipped a knot upon the thongs, and blew his horn. And there\u00ADup\u00ADon, be\u00ADhold, his knights came down upon the pal\u00ADace. And they seized all the host that had come with Gawl, and cast them into his own pris\u00ADon. And Pwyll threw off his rags, and his old shoes, and his tat\u00ADtered ar\u00ADray. And as they came in, eve\u00ADry one of Pwyll's knights struck a blow upon the bag, and asked, \"What is here?\" \"A badg\u00ADer,\" said they. And in this man\u00ADner they played, each of them strik\u00ADing the bag, ei\u00ADther with his foot or with a staff. And thus played they with the bag.
