In the late nine\u00ADteenth cen\u00ADtu\u00ADry, B. Westcott and F. Hort taught that this text had been of\u00ADfi\u00ADcial\u00ADly ed\u00ADited by the fourth-cen\u00ADtu\u00ADry church, but a to\u00ADtal lack of his\u00ADtor\u00ADi\u00ADcal ev\u00ADi\u00ADdence for this event has forced a re\u00ADvi\u00ADsion of the the\u00ADo\u00ADry. It is now wide\u00ADly held that the Byz\u00ADan\u00ADtine Text that large\u00ADly sup\u00ADports the Textus Receptus has as much right as the Al\u00ADex\u00ADan\u00ADdri\u00ADan or any oth\u00ADer tra\u00ADdi\u00ADtion to be weighed in de\u00ADter\u00ADmin\u00ADing the text of the New Tes\u00ADta\u00ADment.
