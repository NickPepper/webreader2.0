Some\u00ADtimes I heard the mel\u00ADan\u00ADcholy tones of his or\u00ADgan; but only at night, in the midst of the deepest ob\u00ADscu\u00ADri\u00ADty, when the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus slept upon the de\u00ADsert\u00ADed ocean. Dur\u00ADing this part of our voy\u00ADage we sailed whole days on the sur\u00ADface of the waves. The sea seemed aban\u00ADdoned. A few sail\u00ADing-ves\u00ADsels, on the road to In\u00ADdia, were mak\u00ADing for the Cape of Good Hope. One day we were fol\u00ADlowed by the boats of a whal\u00ADer, who, no doubt, took us for some enor\u00ADmous whale of great price; but Cap\u00ADtain Nemo did not wish the wor\u00ADthy fel\u00ADlows to lose their time and trou\u00ADble, so ended the chase by plung\u00ADing un\u00ADder the wa\u00ADter.

We had then made about 13,000 leagues since our de\u00ADpar\u00ADture from the high seas of the Pa\u00ADcif\u00ADic. The bear\u00ADings gave us 45@ 37' S. lat., and 37@ 53' W. long.

Then the screw set to work at its max\u00ADi\u00ADmum speed, its four blades beat\u00ADing the waves with in de\u00ADscrib\u00ADa\u00ADble force.

There was only just time to go to the help of the whales. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus went un\u00ADder wa\u00ADter. Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places be\u00ADfore the win\u00ADdow in the sa\u00ADloon, and Cap\u00ADtain Nemo joined the pi\u00ADlot in his cage to work his ap\u00ADpa\u00ADrat\u00ADus as an en\u00ADgine of de\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion. Soon I felt the beat\u00ADings of the screw quick\u00ADen, and our speed in\u00ADcreased. The bat\u00ADtle be\u00ADtween the cach\u00ADa\u00ADlots and the whales had al\u00ADready be\u00ADgun when the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus ar\u00ADrived. They did not at first show any fear at the sight of this new mon\u00ADster join\u00ADing in the con\u00ADflict. But they soon had to guard against its blows. What a bat\u00ADtle! The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus was noth\u00ADing but a for\u00ADmi\u00ADda\u00ADble har\u00ADpoon, bran\u00ADdished by the hand of its Cap\u00ADtain. It hurled it\u00ADself against the fleshy mass, pass\u00ADing through from one part to the oth\u00ADer, leav\u00ADing be\u00ADhind it two quiv\u00ADer\u00ADing halves of the an\u00ADi\u00ADmal. It could not feel the for\u00ADmi\u00ADda\u00ADble blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the shock which it pro\u00ADduced it\u00ADself, much more. One cach\u00ADa\u00ADlot killed, it ran at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, go\u00ADing for\u00ADwards and back\u00ADwards, an\u00ADswer\u00ADing to its helm, plung\u00ADing when the ce\u00ADta\u00ADcean dived into the deep wa\u00ADters, com\u00ADing up with it when it re\u00ADturned to the sur\u00ADface, strik\u00ADing it front or side\u00ADways, cut\u00ADting or tear\u00ADing in all di\u00ADrec\u00ADtions and at any pace, pierc\u00ADing it with its ter\u00ADri\u00ADble spur. What car\u00ADnage! What a noise on the sur\u00ADface of the waves! What sharp hiss\u00ADing, and what snort\u00ADing pe\u00ADcu\u00ADli\u00ADar to these en\u00ADraged an\u00ADi\u00ADmals! In the midst of these wa\u00ADters, gen\u00ADer\u00ADal\u00ADly so peace\u00ADful, their tails made per\u00ADfect bil\u00ADlows. For one hour this whole\u00ADsale mas\u00ADsa\u00ADcre con\u00ADtin\u00ADued, from which the cach\u00ADa\u00ADlots could not es\u00ADcape. Sev\u00ADer\u00ADal times ten or twelve unit\u00ADed tried to crush the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus by their weight. From the win\u00ADdow we could see their enor\u00ADmous mouths, studded with tusks, and their for\u00ADmi\u00ADda\u00ADble eyes. Ned Land could not con\u00ADtain him\u00ADself; he threat\u00ADened and swore at them. We could feel them cling\u00ADing to our ves\u00ADsel like dogs wor\u00ADry\u00ADing a wild boar in a copse. But the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, work\u00ADing its screw, car\u00ADried them here and there, or to the up\u00ADper lev\u00ADels of the ocean, with\u00ADout car\u00ADing for their enor\u00ADmous weight, nor the pow\u00ADer\u00ADful strain on the ves\u00ADsel. At length the mass of cach\u00ADa\u00ADlots broke up, the waves be\u00ADcame qui\u00ADet, and I felt that we were ris\u00ADing to the sur\u00ADface. The pan\u00ADel opened, and we hur\u00ADried on to the plat\u00ADform. The sea was cov\u00ADered with mu\u00ADti\u00ADlat\u00ADed bod\u00ADies.

Thus, guid\u00ADed by this clev\u00ADer hand, the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus passed through all the ice with a pre\u00ADci\u00ADsion which quite charmed Conseil; ice\u00ADbergs or moun\u00ADtains, ice-fields or smooth plains, seem\u00ADing to have no lim\u00ADits, drift-ice or float\u00ADing ice-packs, plains bro\u00ADken up, called palchs when they are cir\u00ADcu\u00ADlar, and streams when they are made up of long strips.

Ice sur\u00ADrounded us on all sides, and closed the ho\u00ADri\u00ADzon. But Cap\u00ADtain Nemo went from one open\u00ADing to an\u00ADoth\u00ADer, still go\u00ADing higher. I can\u00ADnot ex\u00ADpress my aston\u00ADish\u00ADment at the beauties of these new re\u00ADgions. The ice took most sur\u00ADpris\u00ADing forms. Here the group\u00ADing formed an ori\u00ADen\u00ADtal town, with in\u00ADnu\u00ADmer\u00ADa\u00ADble mosques and min\u00ADa\u00ADrets; there a fall\u00ADen city thrown to the earth, as it were, by some con\u00ADvul\u00ADsion of na\u00ADture. The whole as\u00ADpect was con\u00ADstant\u00ADly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the grey\u00ADish fog amidst hur\u00ADri\u00ADcanes of snow. Det\u00ADo\u00ADna\u00ADtions and falls were heard on all sides, great over\u00ADthrows of ice\u00ADbergs, which al\u00ADtered the whole land\u00ADscape like a di\u00ADo\u00ADra\u00ADma.

On the 16th of March, how\u00ADev\u00ADer, the ice-fields ab\u00ADso\u00ADlute\u00ADly blocked our road. It was not the ice\u00ADberg it\u00ADself, as yet, but vast fields ce\u00ADmented by the cold. But this ob\u00ADsta\u00ADcle could not stop Cap\u00ADtain Nemo: he hurled him\u00ADself against it with fright\u00ADful vi\u00ADo\u00ADlence. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus en\u00ADtered the brit\u00ADtle mass like a wedge, and split it with fright\u00ADful crack\u00ADings. It was the bat\u00ADter\u00ADing ram of the an\u00ADcients hurled by in\u00ADfi\u00ADnite strength. The ice, thrown high in the air, fell like hail around us. By its own pow\u00ADer of im\u00ADpul\u00ADsion our ap\u00ADpa\u00ADrat\u00ADus made a ca\u00ADnal for it\u00ADself; some times car\u00ADried away by its own im\u00ADpe\u00ADtus, it lodged on the ice-field, crush\u00ADing it with its weight, and some\u00ADtimes bur\u00ADied be\u00ADneath it, di\u00ADvid\u00ADing it by a sim\u00ADple pitch\u00ADing move\u00ADment, pro\u00ADduc\u00ADing large rents in it. Vi\u00ADo\u00ADlent gales as\u00ADsailed us at this time, ac\u00ADcom\u00ADpa\u00ADnied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the plat\u00ADform to the oth\u00ADer, we could see noth\u00ADing. The wind blew sharp\u00ADly from all parts of the com\u00ADpass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had to break it with blows of a pick\u00ADaxe. The tem\u00ADper\u00ADa\u00ADture was al\u00ADways at 5@ be\u00ADlow zero; eve\u00ADry out\u00ADward part of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus was cov\u00ADered with ice.

The sea was lit with the elec\u00ADtric lan\u00ADtern; but it was de\u00ADsert\u00ADed; fish\u00ADes did not so\u00ADjourn in these im\u00ADpris\u00ADoned wa\u00ADters; they only found there a pas\u00ADsage to take them from the Ant\u00ADarc\u00ADtic Ocean to the open po\u00ADlar sea. Our pace was rap\u00ADid; we could feel it by the quiv\u00ADer\u00ADing of the long steel body. About two in the morn\u00ADing I took some hours' re\u00ADpose, and Conseil did the same. In cross\u00ADing the waist I did not meet Cap\u00ADtain Nemo: I sup\u00ADposed him to be in the pi\u00ADlot's cage. The next morn\u00ADing, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the sa\u00ADloon. The elec\u00ADtric log told me that the speed of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus had been slack\u00ADened. It was then go\u00ADing to\u00ADwards the sur\u00ADface; but pru\u00ADdent\u00ADly emp\u00ADty\u00ADing its res\u00ADer\u00ADvoirs very slow\u00ADly. My heart beat fast. Were we go\u00ADing to emerge and re\u00ADgain the open po\u00ADlar at\u00ADmos\u00ADphere? No! A shock told me that the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus had struck the bot\u00ADtom of the ice\u00ADberg, still very thick, judg\u00ADing from the dead\u00ADened sound. We had in deed \"struck,\" to use a sea ex\u00ADpres\u00ADsion, but in an in\u00ADverse sense, and at a thou\u00ADsand feet deep. This would give three thou\u00ADsand feet of ice above us; one thou\u00ADsand be\u00ADing above the wa\u00ADter-mark. The ice\u00ADberg was then higher than at its bor\u00ADders--not a very reassuring fact. Sev\u00ADer\u00ADal times that day the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus tried again, and eve\u00ADry time it struck the wall which lay like a ceil\u00ADing above it. Some\u00ADtimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of which rose above the sur\u00ADface. It was twice the height it was when the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus had gone un\u00ADder the waves. I care\u00ADful\u00ADly not\u00ADed the dif\u00ADfer\u00ADent depths, and thus ob\u00ADtained a sub\u00ADma\u00ADrine pro\u00ADfile of the chain as it was de\u00ADvel\u00ADoped un\u00ADder the wa\u00ADter. That night no change had tak\u00ADen place in our sit\u00ADu\u00ADa\u00ADtion. Still ice be\u00ADtween four and five hun\u00ADdred yards in depth! It was ev\u00ADi\u00ADdent\u00ADly di\u00ADmin\u00ADish\u00ADing, but, still, what a thick\u00ADness be\u00ADtween us and the sur\u00ADface of the ocean! It was then eight. Ac\u00ADcord\u00ADing to the dai\u00ADly cus\u00ADtom on board the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, its air should have been re\u00ADnewed four hours ago; but I did not suf\u00ADfer much, al\u00ADthough Cap\u00ADtain Nemo had not yet made any de\u00ADmand upon his re\u00ADserve of ox\u00ADy\u00ADgen. My sleep was pain\u00ADful that night; hope and fear be\u00ADsieged me by turns: I rose sev\u00ADer\u00ADal times. The grop\u00ADing of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus con\u00ADtin\u00ADued. About three in the morn\u00ADing, I no\u00ADticed that the low\u00ADer sur\u00ADface of the ice\u00ADberg was only about fif\u00ADty feet deep. One hun\u00ADdred and fif\u00ADty feet now sep\u00ADa\u00ADrat\u00ADed us from the sur\u00ADface of the wa\u00ADters. The ice\u00ADberg was by de\u00ADgrees be\u00ADcom\u00ADing an ice-field, the moun\u00ADtain a plain. My eyes nev\u00ADer left the ma\u00ADnom\u00ADe\u00ADter.

The ice\u00ADberg was stretch\u00ADing both above and be\u00ADneath into length\u00ADen\u00ADing slopes; mile af\u00ADter mile it was get\u00ADting thin\u00ADner. At length, at six in the morn\u00ADing of that mem\u00ADo\u00ADra\u00ADble day, the 19th of March, the door of the sa\u00ADloon opened, and Cap\u00ADtain Nemo ap\u00ADpeared."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/1143","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/1144","J":"\"The sea is open!!\" was all he said."},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/1145","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/1146","A":[{"T":"class","d":"p8"}],"J":"<b>CHAP\u00ADTER XIV</b>"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/1147","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/1148","J":"THE SOUTH POLE"},{"B":"#text","C":"/4/1149","J":"\n"},{"B":"p","C":"/4/1150","J":"I rushed on to the plat\u00ADform.
