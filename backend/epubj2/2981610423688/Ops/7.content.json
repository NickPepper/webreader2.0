The boat took with me Cap\u00ADtain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the in\u00ADstru\u00ADments, which con\u00ADsisted of a chro\u00ADnom\u00ADe\u00ADter, a tel\u00ADe\u00ADscope, and a ba\u00ADrom\u00ADe\u00ADter.

Cap\u00ADtain Nemo went to\u00ADwards the peak, which he doubt\u00ADless meant to be his ob\u00ADser\u00ADva\u00ADto\u00ADry.

For a man un\u00ADac\u00ADcus\u00ADtomed to walk on land, the Cap\u00ADtain climbed the steep slopes with an agil\u00ADi\u00ADty I nev\u00ADer saw equalled and which a hunt\u00ADer would have en\u00ADvied. We were two hours get\u00ADting to the sum\u00ADmit of this peak, which was half por\u00ADphy\u00ADry and half ba\u00ADsalt. From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, to\u00ADwards the north, dis\u00ADtinct\u00ADly traced its bound\u00ADa\u00ADry line upon the sky. At our feet lay fields of dazzling white\u00ADness. Over our heads a pale az\u00ADure, free from fog. To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire, al\u00ADready horned by the cut\u00ADting of the ho\u00ADri\u00ADzon. From the bos\u00ADom of the wa\u00ADter rose sheaves of liq\u00ADuid jets by hun\u00ADdreds. In the dis\u00ADtance lay the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus like a ce\u00ADta\u00ADcean asleep on the wa\u00ADter. Be\u00ADhind us, to the south and east, an im\u00ADmense coun\u00ADtry and a cha\u00ADot\u00ADic heap of rocks and ice, the lim\u00ADits of which were not vis\u00ADi\u00ADble.

Long sound\u00ADing lines were sunk in the side walls, but af\u00ADter fif\u00ADteen yards they were again stopped by the thick wall. It was use\u00ADless to at\u00ADtack it on the ceil\u00ADing-like sur\u00ADface, since the ice\u00ADberg it\u00ADself meas\u00ADured more than 400 yards in height. Cap\u00ADtain Nemo then sounded the low\u00ADer sur\u00ADface. There ten yards of wall sep\u00ADa\u00ADrat\u00ADed us from the wa\u00ADter, so great was the thick\u00ADness of the ice-field. It was nec\u00ADes\u00ADsary, there\u00ADfore, to cut from it a piece equal in ex\u00ADtent to the wa\u00ADter\u00ADline of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus. There were about 6,000 cu\u00ADbic yards to de\u00ADtach, so as to dig a hole by which we could de\u00ADscend to the ice-field. The work had be\u00ADgun im\u00ADme\u00ADdi\u00ADate\u00ADly and car\u00ADried on with in\u00ADde\u00ADfat\u00ADi\u00ADga\u00ADble en\u00ADer\u00ADgy. In\u00ADstead of dig\u00ADging round the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus which would have in\u00ADvolved great\u00ADer dif\u00ADfi\u00ADcul\u00ADty, Cap\u00ADtain Nemo had an im\u00ADmense trench made at eight yards from the port-quar\u00ADter.

I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was con\u00ADscious of the ag\u00ADo\u00ADny that was com\u00ADing over me. I felt as if I was go\u00ADing to die. Sud\u00ADden\u00ADly I came to.

We ought, be\u00ADfore long, to set\u00ADtle this im\u00ADpor\u00ADtant point. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus went at a rap\u00ADid pace. The po\u00ADlar cir\u00ADcle was soon passed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. We were off the Amer\u00ADi\u00ADcan point, March 31st, at sev\u00ADen o'clock in the eve\u00ADning. Then all our past suf\u00ADfer\u00ADings were for\u00ADgot\u00ADten. The re\u00ADmem\u00ADbrance of that im\u00ADpris\u00ADon\u00ADment in the ice was ef\u00ADfaced from our minds. We only thought of the fu\u00ADture. Cap\u00ADtain Nemo did not ap\u00ADpear again ei\u00ADther in the draw\u00ADing-room or on the plat\u00ADform. The point shown each day on the plan\u00ADi\u00ADsphere, and, marked by the lieu\u00ADten\u00ADant, showed me the ex\u00ADact di\u00ADrec\u00ADtion of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus. Now, on that eve\u00ADning, it was ev\u00ADi\u00ADdent, to, my great sat\u00ADis\u00ADfac\u00ADtion, that we were go\u00ADing back to the North by the At\u00ADlan\u00ADtic. The next day, April 1st, when the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus as\u00ADcended to the sur\u00ADface some min\u00ADutes be\u00ADfore noon, we sight\u00ADed land to the west. It was Ter\u00ADra del Fuego, which the first nav\u00ADi\u00ADga\u00ADtors named thus from see\u00ADing the quan\u00ADti\u00ADty of smoke that rose from the na\u00ADtives' huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the dis\u00ADtance rose high moun\u00ADtains. I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the lev\u00ADel of the sea, with a very point\u00ADed sum\u00ADmit, which, ac\u00ADcord\u00ADing as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or of wet weath\u00ADer. At this mo\u00ADment the peak was clear\u00ADly de\u00ADfined against the sky. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, div\u00ADing again un\u00ADder the wa\u00ADter, ap\u00ADproached the coast, which was only some few miles off. From the glass win\u00ADdows in the draw\u00ADing-room, I saw long sea\u00ADweeds and gi\u00ADgan\u00ADtic fuci and varech, of which the open po\u00ADlar sea con\u00ADtains so many spec\u00ADi\u00ADmens, with their sharp pol\u00ADished fil\u00ADa\u00ADments; they meas\u00ADured about 300 yards in length-- real ca\u00ADbles, thicker than one's thumb; and, hav\u00ADing great tenacity, they are of\u00ADten used as ropes for ves\u00ADsels. An\u00ADoth\u00ADer weed known as velp, with leaves four feet long, bur\u00ADied in the cor\u00ADal con\u00ADcre\u00ADtions, hung at the bot\u00ADtom. It served as nest and food for myr\u00ADi\u00ADads of crus\u00ADta\u00ADcea and mol\u00ADluscs, crabs, and cut\u00ADtle\u00ADfish. There seals and ot\u00ADters had splen\u00ADdid re\u00ADpasts, eat\u00ADing the flesh of fish with sea-veg\u00ADe\u00ADta\u00ADbles, ac\u00ADcord\u00ADing to the Eng\u00ADlish fash\u00ADion.

The depth of the sea was mod\u00ADer\u00ADate.

The tem\u00ADpest burst on the 18th of May, just as the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus was float\u00ADing off Long Is\u00ADland, some miles from the port of New York. I can de\u00ADscribe this strife of the el\u00ADe\u00ADments! for, in\u00ADstead of flee\u00ADing to the depths of the sea, Cap\u00ADtain Nemo, by an un\u00ADac\u00ADcount\u00ADa\u00ADble ca\u00ADprice, would brave it at the sur\u00ADface. The wind blew from the south-west at first. Cap\u00ADtain Nemo, dur\u00ADing the squalls, had tak\u00ADen his place on the plat\u00ADform. He had made him\u00ADself fast, to pre\u00ADvent be\u00ADing washed over\u00ADboard by the mon\u00ADstrous waves. I had hoisted my\u00ADself up, and made my\u00ADself fast also, di\u00ADvid\u00ADing my ad\u00ADmi\u00ADra\u00ADtion be\u00ADtween the tem\u00ADpest and this ex\u00ADtraor\u00ADdi\u00ADnary man who was cop\u00ADing with it. The rag\u00ADing sea was swept by huge cloud-drifts, which were ac\u00ADtu\u00ADal\u00ADly sat\u00ADu\u00ADrat\u00ADed with the waves. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, some\u00ADtimes ly\u00ADing on its side, some\u00ADtimes stand\u00ADing up like a mast, rolled and pitched ter\u00ADri\u00ADbly. About five o'clock a tor\u00ADrent of rain fell, that lulled nei\u00ADther sea nor wind. The hur\u00ADri cane blew near\u00ADly for\u00ADty leagues an hour. It is un\u00ADder these con\u00ADdi\u00ADtions that it over\u00ADturns hous\u00ADes, breaks iron gates, dis\u00ADplaces twen\u00ADty-four pound\u00ADers. How\u00ADev\u00ADer, the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, in the midst of the tem\u00ADpest, con\u00ADfirmed the words of a clev\u00ADer en\u00ADgi\u00ADneer, \"There is no well-con\u00ADstructed hull that can\u00ADnot defy the sea.\" This was not a re\u00ADsist\u00ADing rock; it was a steel spin\u00ADdle, obe\u00ADdi\u00ADent and mov\u00ADa\u00ADble, with\u00ADout rig\u00ADging or masts, that braved its fury with im\u00ADpu\u00ADni\u00ADty. How\u00ADev\u00ADer, I watched these rag\u00ADing waves at\u00ADten\u00ADtive\u00ADly. They meas\u00ADured fif\u00ADteen feet in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their speed of prop\u00ADa\u00ADga\u00ADtion was thir\u00ADty feet per se\u00ADcond. Their bulk and pow\u00ADer in\u00ADcreased with the depth of the wa\u00ADter. Such waves as these, at the Heb\u00ADri\u00ADdes, have dis\u00ADplaced a mass weigh\u00ADing 8,400 lb. They are they which, in the tem\u00ADpest of De\u00ADcem\u00ADber 23rd, 1864, af\u00ADter de\u00ADstroy\u00ADing the town of Yeddo, in Ja\u00ADpan, broke the same day on the shores of Amer\u00ADi\u00ADca. The in\u00ADten\u00ADsi\u00ADty of the tem\u00ADpest in\u00ADcreased with the night. The ba\u00ADrom\u00ADe\u00ADter, as in 1860 at Re\u00ADun\u00ADion dur\u00ADing a cy\u00ADclone, fell sev\u00ADen-tenths at the close of day. I saw a large ves\u00ADsel pass the ho\u00ADri\u00ADzon struggling pain\u00ADful\u00ADly. She was try\u00ADing to lie to un\u00ADder half steam, to keep up above the waves. It was prob\u00ADa\u00ADbly one of the steam\u00ADers of the line from New York to Liv\u00ADer\u00ADpool, or Ha\u00ADvre. It soon dis\u00ADap\u00ADpeared in the gloom. At ten o'clock in the eve\u00ADning the sky was on fire. The at\u00ADmos\u00ADphere was streaked with viv\u00ADid light\u00ADning. I could not bear the bright\u00ADness of it; while the cap\u00ADtain, look\u00ADing at it, seemed to envy the spir\u00ADit of the tem\u00ADpest. A ter\u00ADri\u00ADble noise filled the air, a com\u00ADplex noise, made up of the howls of the crushed waves, the roar\u00ADing of the wind, and the claps of thun\u00ADder. The wind veered sud\u00ADden\u00ADly to all points of the ho\u00ADri\u00ADzon; and the cy\u00ADclone, ris\u00ADing in the east, re\u00ADturned af\u00ADter pass\u00ADing by the north, west, and south, in the in\u00ADverse course pur\u00ADsued by the cir\u00ADcu\u00ADlar storm of the south\u00ADern hem\u00ADi\u00ADsphere. Ah, that Gulf Stream! It de\u00ADserves its name of the King of Tem\u00ADpests. It is that which causes those for\u00ADmi\u00ADda\u00ADble cy\u00ADclones, by the dif\u00ADfer\u00ADence of tem\u00ADper\u00ADa\u00ADture be\u00ADtween its air and its cur\u00ADrents. A show\u00ADer of fire had suc\u00ADceeded the rain. The drops of wa\u00ADter were changed to sharp spikes. One would have thought that Cap\u00ADtain Nemo was court\u00ADing a death wor\u00ADthy of him\u00ADself, a death by light\u00ADning. As the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus, pitch\u00ADing dread\u00ADful\u00ADly, raised its steel spur in the air, it seemed to act as a con\u00ADduc\u00ADtor, and I saw long sparks burst from it. Crushed and with\u00ADout strength I crawled to the pan\u00ADel, opened it, and de\u00ADscended to the sa\u00ADloon. The storm was then at its height. It was im\u00ADpos\u00ADsi\u00ADble to stand up\u00ADright in the in\u00ADte\u00ADri\u00ADor of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus. Cap\u00ADtain Nemo came down about twelve. I heard the res\u00ADer\u00ADvoirs fill\u00ADing by de\u00ADgrees, and the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus sank slow\u00ADly be\u00ADneath the waves. Through the open win\u00ADdows in the sa\u00ADloon I saw large fish ter\u00ADri\u00ADfied, pass\u00ADing like phan\u00ADtoms in the wa\u00ADter. Some were struck be\u00ADfore my eyes. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus was still de\u00ADscend\u00ADing. I thought that at about eight fath\u00ADoms deep we should find a calm. But no! the up\u00ADper beds were too violently ag\u00ADi\u00ADtat\u00ADed for that. We had to seek re\u00ADpose at more than twen\u00ADty-five fath\u00ADoms in the bow\u00ADels of the deep.

On tak\u00ADing the bear\u00ADings by the chart, I saw that we were pass\u00ADing the mouth of the Manche, and that our course was hur\u00ADry\u00ADing us to\u00ADwards the north\u00ADern seas at a fright\u00ADful speed. That night we had crossed two hun\u00ADdred leagues of the At\u00ADlan\u00ADtic. The shad\u00ADows fell, and the sea was cov\u00ADered with dark\u00ADness un\u00ADtil the ris\u00ADing of the moon. I went to my room, but could not sleep. I was troubled with dread\u00ADful night\u00ADmare. The hor\u00ADri\u00ADble scene of de\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion was con\u00ADtin\u00ADu\u00ADal\u00ADly be\u00ADfore my eyes. From that day, who could tell into what part of the North At\u00ADlan\u00ADtic ba\u00ADsin the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus would take us? Still with un\u00ADac\u00ADcount\u00ADa\u00ADble speed. Still in the midst of these north\u00ADern fogs. Would it tou\u00ADch at Spitz\u00ADber\u00ADgen, or on the shores of Nova Zembla? Should we ex\u00ADplore those un\u00ADknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea of Kara, the Gulf of Obi, the Ar\u00ADchi\u00ADpel\u00ADa\u00ADgo of Liarrov, and the un\u00ADknown coast of Asia? I could not say. I could no long\u00ADer judge of the time that was pass\u00ADing. The clocks had been stopped on board. It seemed, as in po\u00ADlar countries, that night and day no long\u00ADer fol\u00ADlowed their reg\u00ADu\u00ADlar course. I felt my\u00ADself be\u00ADing drawn into that strange re\u00ADgion where the found\u00ADered im\u00ADag\u00ADi\u00ADna\u00ADtion of Ed\u00ADgar Poe roamed at will. Like the fab\u00ADu\u00ADlous Gor\u00ADdon Pym, at eve\u00ADry mo\u00ADment I ex\u00ADpected to see \"that veiled hu\u00ADman fig\u00ADure, of larg\u00ADer pro\u00ADpor\u00ADtions than those of any in\u00ADhab\u00ADit\u00ADant of the earth, thrown across the cat\u00ADa\u00ADract which de\u00ADfends the ap\u00ADproach to the pole.\" I es\u00ADti\u00ADmat\u00ADed (though, per\u00ADhaps, I may be mis\u00ADtak\u00ADen)--I es\u00ADti\u00ADmat\u00ADed this ad\u00ADven\u00ADtur\u00ADous course of the Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus to have lasted fif\u00ADteen or twen\u00ADty days. And I know not how much long\u00ADer it might have lasted, had it not been for the ca\u00ADtas\u00ADtro\u00ADphe which ended this voy\u00ADage. Of Cap\u00ADtain Nemo I saw noth\u00ADing what\u00ADev\u00ADer now, nor of his se\u00ADcond. Not a man of the crew was vis\u00ADi\u00ADble for an in\u00ADstant. The Nau\u00ADti\u00ADlus was al\u00ADmost in\u00ADces\u00ADsant\u00ADly un\u00ADder wa\u00ADter. When we came to the sur\u00ADface to re\u00ADnew the air, the pan\u00ADels opened and shut me\u00ADchan\u00ADi\u00ADcal\u00ADly. There were no more marks on the plan\u00ADi\u00ADsphere. I knew not where we were. And the Ca\u00ADna\u00ADdi\u00ADan, too, his strength and pa\u00ADtience at an end, ap\u00ADpeared no more. Conseil could not draw a word from him; and, fear\u00ADing that, in a dread\u00ADful fit of mad\u00ADness, he might kill him\u00ADself, watched him with con\u00ADstant de\u00ADvo\u00ADtion. One morn\u00ADing (what date it was I could not say) I had fall\u00ADen into a heavy sleep to\u00ADwards the ear\u00ADly hours, a sleep both pain\u00ADful and un\u00ADhealthy, when I sud\u00ADden\u00ADly awoke.
