We don\u2019t know much about Sekhemkhet ex\u00ADcept that he ap\u00ADpar\u00ADent\u00ADly suf\u00ADfered from insecurities; in a clas\u00ADsic dis\u00ADplay of mine-is-big\u00ADger, Sekhemkhet\u2019s pyr\u00ADa\u00ADmid was planned to rise sev\u00ADen steps, not six as Djoser\u2019s had. But Sekhemkhet\u2019s pyr\u00ADa\u00ADmid was nev\u00ADer com\u00ADplet\u00ADed. He died six years into his reign, and the con\u00ADstruc\u00ADtion on the Un\u00ADfin\u00ADished Pyr\u00ADa\u00ADmid halted at the first lay\u00ADer."
