A lat\u00ADer form of writ\u00ADing, which we call Protosinaitic be\u00ADcause it shows up in var\u00ADi\u00ADous places around the Si\u00ADnai pen\u00ADin\u00ADsu\u00ADla, bor\u00ADrowed al\u00ADmost half of its signs from Egyp\u00ADtian hi\u00ADer\u00ADo\u00ADglyphs. Protosinaitic, in turn, ap\u00ADpears to have lent a few of its let\u00ADters to the Phoe\u00ADni\u00ADci\u00ADans, who used it in their al\u00ADpha\u00ADbet. The Greeks then bor\u00ADrowed the Phoe\u00ADni\u00ADci\u00ADan al\u00ADpha\u00ADbet, turned it side\u00ADways, and passed it on to the Ro\u00ADmans, and thence to us; so that the mag\u00ADi\u00ADcal signs of the Egyp\u00ADtians have, in fact, come as close to im\u00ADmor\u00ADtal\u00ADi\u00ADty as any mor\u00ADtal in\u00ADven\u00ADtion that we know."
