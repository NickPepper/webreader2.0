But Kish lay be\u00ADtween the two riv\u00ADers, a po\u00ADsi\u00ADtion which sim\u00ADply cried out for some ex\u00ADer\u00ADcise of overlordship. Su\u00ADmer, af\u00ADter all, had no na\u00ADtive wood; only a few im\u00ADported palm trees, which make for third-rate build\u00ADing ma\u00ADte\u00ADri\u00ADal. There was no stone, no cop\u00ADper, no ob\u00ADsid\u00ADi\u00ADan, noth\u00ADing but mud and a few de\u00ADpos\u00ADits of bi\u00ADtu\u00ADmen (as\u00ADphalt, used as \u201Cpitch\u201D in torches and as a mor\u00ADtar-bin\u00ADder). Wood had to be shipped down from the north\u00ADeast\u00ADern Zagros Moun\u00ADtains, or brought from the Leb\u00ADa\u00ADnon Moun\u00ADtains to the north\u00ADwest. Cop\u00ADper came from the south\u00ADern Ara\u00ADbi\u00ADan moun\u00ADtains, la\u00ADpis laz\u00ADu\u00ADli from the rocky lands north and east; stone from the de\u00ADsert to the west and ob\u00ADsid\u00ADi\u00ADan from the far north. In ex\u00ADchange, the Su\u00ADme\u00ADri\u00ADan cit\u00ADies traded the goods of an ag\u00ADri\u00ADcul\u00ADtur\u00ADal so\u00ADci\u00ADe\u00ADty: grain, cloth, leath\u00ADer, pot\u00ADtery. Su\u00ADme\u00ADri\u00ADan pots and bowls show up in a wide swath of lit\u00ADtle set\u00ADtle\u00ADments and towns all across east\u00ADern Eu\u00ADrope and north\u00ADern Asia."
