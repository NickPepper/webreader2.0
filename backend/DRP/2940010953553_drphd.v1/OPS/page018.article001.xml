<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">TIME EVERLASTING </p><br/><p class="no-indent">The Brooklyn Academy of Music gets schooled in minimalism.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">IN THE LATE twentieth century, a lot of avant-garde performance work was very long. The Philip Glass/Robert Wilson opera “Einstein on the Beach” (1976) lasted, notoriously, for five hours, though you were invited to get up and go to the bar or the bathroom during the show. Often, with the length, came repetition. Laura Dean’s dancers spun forever; Lucinda Childs’s company performed the same phrase, or close to it, again and again. The Europeans joined in. When Pina Bausch, in 1984, started bringing her Tanztheater Wuppertal to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, you were decidedly not invited to wander in and out during her long pieces. Some of these works made you want to die. In others, you passed through boredom into the zone. As Robert Wilson said of “Einstein on the Beach,” “It’s a work where you can go and get lost. That’s the idea.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">With the advent of postmodernism, and its affection for the old ways, this fashion waned in the United States, but the flag is still being carried by certain European choreographers—for example, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, who began, it seemed, as an heir of Bausch. What a thrill De Keersmaeker and her Belgian company were—grim-faced girls, in what looked like gym clothes—when, in 1986, they first appeared at BAM, cycling through maybe a dozen phrases among themselves for the better part of an hour and a half. Almost thirty years have passed since then, but De Keersmaeker has not abandoned the idea of doing things over and over again, for a long time.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">This week, she brings to BAM two works, “En Atendant,” which will be performed in the afternoon, and “Cesena,” which will follow in the evening. They are different from her earlier material: wiser, even exalted. Both were premièred at the annual dance festival in Avignon, the city to which the Papacy moved in 1309, and where it stayed for sixty-nine years. Both partake of fourteenth-century religiosity—“En Atendant” was performed in a cloister, “Cesena” in front of the papal palace—and both, in accord with the Roman church as well as twentieth-century vanguardism, seem to view our lives in the mirror of eternity. “En Atendant,” spanning an hour and a half, begins as night is falling and ends in darkness. “Cesena,” which, at its Avignon première, started at 4:30 A.M., represents the passage from dawn to morning. It lasts almost two hours. Both dances show little pattern, and the attack is sometimes soft. (In “En Atendant,” a man lies down, sits up, takes off his shoes, then picks them up and walks offstage.) And yet, especially in “Cesena,” there seems to be an underlying passion, conveyed, above all, in the dance’s counterpoint between the movement and the beautiful, pre-harmonic fourteenth-century music. Describing the flute song at the beginning of “En Atendant,” De Keersmaeker said that it “introduces the idea of infinite waiting, suspending time.” This could be said of the whole show.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">—Joan Acocella</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">San Francisco Ballet </p><p class="no-indent">This fine troupe, led since 1985 by the former New York City Ballet star Helgi Tomasson, visits New York for the first time in five years. The first part of its two-week run consists of mixed bills with works by Mark Morris, Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon, and Wayne McGregor. Many are from the last two years, and almost all of them are new to New York audiences. Ratmansky’s “From Foreign Lands” is a playful take on the nineteenth-century divertissement, each section depicting a dance style from a different corner of Europe. McGregor’s “Borderlands” attempts to conjure the world inside a Josef Albers painting; “Beaux,” for nine men clad in pastel camouflage by Isaac Mizrahi, is a whimsical take on male technique by Mark Morris. Wheeldon offers the lyrical “Ghosts,” a ballet with echoes of “Giselle”; his lavish new “Cinderella,” adorned by the puppeteer Basil Twist’s magical tree, follows in the second week. • Oct. 16 and Oct. 19 at 8: “Trio,” “Ghosts,” and “Borderlands.” • Oct. 17-18 at 8: “From Foreign Lands,” “Beaux,” “Classical Symphony,” and “Symphonic Dances.” • Oct. 19 at 2: “Trio,” “Ghosts,” and “Suite en Blanc.” • Oct. 20 at 2: “Suite en Blanc,” “From Foreign Lands,” and “Symphonic Dances.” (David H. Koch, Lincoln Center. 212-496-0600. Through Oct. 27.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">David Dorfman / “Come, and Back Again” </p><p class="no-indent">Dorfman’s energetic, openhearted work is a kind of love letter to life, tinged with an aching nostalgia for what is lost along the way. A wall of junk, by the Brooklyn-based sculptor Jonah Emerson-Bell, looms over the five dancers, including the fifty-seven-year-old Dorfman, like the piled-up detritus of several lifetimes. The candor of the work is underlined by the raw, un-slick sound of its rock-and-roll score, by the Atlanta-based band Smoke. (BAM’s Harvey Theatre, 651 Fulton St., Brooklyn. 718-636-4100. Oct. 16-19 at 7:30.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Lar Lubovitch Dance Company </p><p class="no-indent">The final week of the company’s forty-fifth-anniversary season focusses on recent work, admirably accompanied by live music, much of it admirably new. “Transparent Things” (2012) is set to Debussy, but “Crazy 8s,” a première, features a score by the imaginative Randall Woolf, and in “As Sleep Befell” (2013), five men dream together to a wordless lullaby by Paola Prestini. Would that the handsome choreography were less sedative. (Joyce Theatre, 175 Eighth Ave., at 19th St. 212-242-0800. Oct. 16 at 7:30, Oct. 17-18 at 8, Oct. 19 at 2 and 8, and Oct. 20 at 2 and 7:30.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Melanie Maar </p><p class="no-indent">Remaining tranquil and contained, Maar’s acute dancing can seem white-hot and unruly. Her austere, ritualistic dances are uncommonly good at evoking, without representing, the natural world. In “Our Other,” she is joined by Lauren Atwell and Marilyn Maywald for an exploration of selfhood and empathy. (Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church In-the-Bowery, Second Ave. at 10th St. 866-811-4111. Oct. 17-19 at 8.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Boris Charmatz </p><p class="no-indent">In recent years, dance in museums has become nearly commonplace. With “Musée de la Danse: Three Collective Gestures,” a three-weekend series at the Museum of Modern Art, the maverick French choreographer pushes the idea further. First comes “20 Dancers for the XX Century,” in which performers circulate through the galleries performing notable dance solos—probably the closest possible approximation to hanging dance on the walls. (11 W. 53rd St. 212-708-9400. Oct. 18-20 at noon.)</p></div>
