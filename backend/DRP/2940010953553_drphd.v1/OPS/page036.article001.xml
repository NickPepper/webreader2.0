<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">Elizabeth Smart sat backstage in a ballroom of the Washington Hilton hotel, where, in a few minutes, she would be telling an audience of sixteen hundred teen-agers her story of survival. It has been eleven years since a vagrant abducted Smart from her family’s home, in Salt Lake City, when she was fourteen. After nine months of captivity, during which she was repeatedly raped and threatened with murder, she was rescued by the police, in Utah. Smart’s speech was the keynote address of the annual conference of Key Club International. It was a steamy July day, but Smart looked composed in a ruffle-collared black dress, her blond hair in a chignon. She had no notes. I told her that I liked her red shoes, which reminded me of the ruby slippers that Dorothy clicks to return home from Oz. “Every girl should have a pair,” she said. “Don’t you think?”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">At the lectern, Smart began by conjuring the kind of ordinary girl she was when she went to bed on June 4, 2002. That evening, she’d spent a lot of time persuading her parents to let her join her best friend’s family on a vacation to a small town in Utah, only to have her older brother, Charles, tease her about how boring the trip was sure to be. She’d shot back, “Hey, what if those are the last words you ever say to me?” The audience laughed, nervously. A few minutes later, Smart arrived at the part of her story where she woke in the middle of the night with a knife at her throat. The ballroom got very quiet.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Although Smart will never escape being associated with the lurid captivity she endured, she has chosen to remain a public figure and has been unusually successful at doing so on her own terms. She is a full-time advocate for the prevention of child abuse who lobbies for legislation and heads a foundation. She delivers some eighty speeches a year, and they reliably end on a note of quiet resilience. She told the teen-agers in Washington, “Never be afraid to speak out. Never be afraid to live your life. Never let your past dictate your future.” </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart is a member of a tiny sorority of women who have escaped from modern-day Bluebeards and shared their stories. Among them is Jaycee Dugard, who, at the age of eleven, was snatched off a California street by a man with a stun gun; she survived eighteen years of captivity and, after being raped repeatedly by her kidnapper, had two children with him. Natascha Kampusch was enslaved in a tidy house in Austria for eight years; Sabine Dardenne, of Belgium, was abducted at the age of twelve by a serial killer, who tortured her in his basement for three months. All these women subsequently wrote books—Smart’s memoir, “My Story,” has just been published. Although their accounts document appalling abuse, the authors display an elemental will to live that is deeply affecting. The memoirs also serve as ripostes to the media scrutiny that followed their ordeals: Why hadn’t they run? Had they developed unseemly bonds with their captors? The girls in fairy tales who escaped from ogres never had to face a blogosphere, or Nancy Grace.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In 2006, in a CNN interview with Grace, Smart showed the self-possession, and the lightly sarcastic resolve, that has marked her public appearances ever since. Smart was then eighteen, and she had gone on Grace’s program in order to promote a bill that would establish a national registry for sex offenders. Grace, who is not known for her interest in the nuances of social policy, immediately homed in on the details of the kidnapping. She asked Smart if she ever heard searchers calling out for her.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“There was one time,” Smart replied.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Did you want to scream out, ‘Here I am, help me’?”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“I mean, of course. Who wouldn’t?” Smart said, in a tone that was at once polite and admonitory.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“You were afraid, I assume?”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Yeah,” Smart said, as though she were saying, “Duh.” She shot a sidelong glance—very nearly an eye roll—at someone off screen. It was the kind of frame-breaking moment rarely seen on cable news. “I’m not here to give an interview on that,” Smart said. “I’m here to help push the bill through.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">But Grace wanted to discuss the odd clothing that Smart’s captor, Brian David Mitchell, had forced her to wear. Before her rescue, Smart had appeared many times on the streets of Utah, hidden beneath a robe and a veil. “A lot of people have seen shots of you wearing a burka,” Grace said. “How did you see out of that thing?”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart said, “To be frankly honest, I really don’t appreciate your bringing this up.” Grace, chastened, asked about the bill.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In “My Story,” Smart tries to steer the reader away from seeing her experience as so bizarre that it warrants more curiosity than compassion. She stresses the fundamental qualities of her suffering: hunger, thirst, loneliness. The book often reads like a young-adult novel—a survival yarn in the vein of “The Island of the Blue Dolphins.” Smart’s memoir, which was written with Chris Stewart—a Republican congressman from Utah who has published such inspirational books as “Seven Miracles That Saved America”—is not graphic in its descriptions of forced sex and other cruelties. Nor is “My Story” an analytical book: it does not probe her abductor’s state of mind or her own. Its power lies in the way Smart presents herself, as a pure girl who emerged from degradation purer still—stronger but somehow still innocent. Every so often, there are touches of ironic wit. “Of course!” she remembers thinking as Mitchell herded her into a dollar store to purchase a disguise. “The perfect place to buy a quality wig!”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart had thought carefully about the book’s tone. “It’s not so gruesome that it would be unbearable to read,” she said. “That was important to me.” Her goal as a public figure is to make “talking about rape and abuse not such a taboo.” Although cable news and police dramas are filled with chronicles of sex crimes, Smart’s approach is distinctive: at once ladylike, frank, and unembarrassed. At one point, Smart, who got married last year, told me, “There’s a huge difference between rape and sex. Having experienced both, I know it’s not the same thing.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Steve Daley, a former police officer who directs radKIDS, a self-defense program for children that Smart supports, says of her, “She has this poise and calmness and a power that provide hope. She turns a light on when you’re dealing with this very dark subject matter.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart rejects many of the tropes that cling to kidnapping stories: that victims are forever damaged; that Stockholm syndrome explains her extended captivity; that other people in her situation would have resisted more forcefully and escaped. “Nobody should ever question why you didn’t do something,” Smart told me. “They have no idea what they would have done, and they certainly have no right to judge you. Everything I did I did to survive. And I did. Maybe there were times that, had I done more, I would have been rescued. But maybe I wouldn’t have. So do I regret anything I did? No.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In 2002, Elizabeth Smart shared a bedroom with her nine-year-old sister, Mary Katherine. The Smarts—Ed and Lois and their six children, of whom Elizabeth is the second oldest—ate dinner together every night at six. On the day of the kidnapping, they rushed through the meal in an attempt to get Elizabeth to a school event where she was to play the harp. The house still smelled of the potatoes that Lois had burned in her haste. That night, before turning out the light, Elizabeth put on her red silk pajamas—her mom had a matching pair—and read “Ella Enchanted” to Mary Katherine.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">She woke up to a male voice hissing in her ear and the sensation of something cold at her throat—the knife. “Don’t make a sound,” the man said. “Get out of bed, or I’ll kill you and your family.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart had no idea how the man had got into her bedroom. As far as she could tell, Mary Katherine was still asleep. The man told her to grab shoes and, pressing the knife against her, prodded her out of the house.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Federal Heights, the Salt Lake City neighborhood where the Smarts lived, is tucked into the base of the Wasatch Mountains. Mitchell led Smart through steep, rugged terrain: heavy underbrush, big boulders, a dry streambed walled in by thickets of scrub oak. After a while, Smart realized that her captor, who had dark hair and a scraggly gray beard, was a local beggar. Her mother had once given him money on the street, and her father had hired him to do work on their roof. She didn’t know him as Brian David Mitchell; he had told the Smarts that his name was Immanuel. At the Salt Lake Temple, he had once been chosen to portray Satan in Biblical reënactments. But the church had recently excommunicated him for issuing his own prophecies and revelations.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Why are you doing this?” Elizabeth asked Mitchell.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“You are my hostage,” he said. “You’ll learn.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart had a dreadful thought: if Mitchell took her far from home and then murdered her, her parents might never know what had happened to her. They might even think that she had run away. “If you’re going to rape and kill me, please do it here,” she said. “That way, someone will find my body.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Keep moving,” Mitchell replied.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">As the sun came up, they crested a ridge and staggered into a grove of mountain oaks. Mitchell had set up a camp there, which was being tended by a woman in a long robe. Mitchell called her Hephzibah. Her real name was Wanda Barzee, and she was his wife. In the mid-eighties, they’d met at a group-therapy session run by the Mormon Church—Barzee newly divorced, and Mitchell in a collapsing marriage. Barzee had eventually abandoned her children to be with him, and they’d spent the intervening years panhandling across the country and occasionally pulling a small covered wagon, like the Utah pioneers. Barzee had accepted Mitchell’s revelations—including one commanding him to take a series of Mormon girls as wives. In “My Story,” Smart writes, “I studied her hopefully, but her hard stance and cold eyes told me she was anything but a friend. She had a wild look about her, emotional and tense, like a strand of wire that was being pulled too tight.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">The woman told Smart to take off her clothes. Smart wept and refused, but complied after Barzee warned her that Mitchell would rip them off. When Mitchell told Smart that she was now his wife, she screamed, and he threatened to cover her mouth with duct tape. She told him that she hadn’t even started her period yet, and Mitchell asked Barzee if that was a problem. She said no, and he raped Smart.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart has said that, afterward, she “didn’t feel like a whole person anymore.” She felt “dirty” and “broken.” She asked herself, “Who would ever love me?” She even wondered if her family would want her back.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Last spring, at Johns Hopkins University, Smart gave a particularly forthright speech at a conference on sex trafficking. She recalled her abject state after the rape, and attributed the depth of her feelings, in part, to the emphasis that Mormon culture places on sexual purity. She spoke of a former teacher who had promoted abstinence by saying, “Imagine you’re a stick of gum, and when you engage in sex that’s like getting chewed. And then if you do that lots of times you’re going to become an old piece of gum, and who’s going to want you after that?” Smart told the crowd, “Nobody should ever say that.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">The speech received considerable media attention. The Washington Post he Washington Post summed up Smart’s comments with the headline “MORMON TEACHING ON SEX STOPPED ME FROM ESCAPING KIDNAPPERS.” Smart told me that she wanted to clarify her point. She had been lamenting that victims of sexual abuse often feel that they are “no longer as good as everybody else.” Nobody should have the power to take away another person’s self-worth, Smart told me. But abstinence education was hardly the only way that victims of sexual assault could be shamed. A girl could be humiliated through social media—Smart and I talked about the incident last year in Steubenville, Ohio, in which high-school students recorded an assault with cell-phone cameras and mocked the victim on Twitter. Smart told me, “I can’t tell you how many women I’ve met who say, ‘When I was this age, I was raped, but it was kind of my fault, because of X, Y, or Z.’ And I just want to pull my hair out.” Autumn Hanna VandeHei, an organizer of the Johns Hopkins conference, told me in an e-mail that when Smart was invited to participate she “initially didn’t understand how she could be helpful.” But when VandeHei told Smart “how many of these girls are judged after coming out of trafficking for not leaving their pimps/captors—for not running away—she became very indignant, and was passionate and defensive on behalf of the trafficking survivors.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">After the rape, Smart curled up on some dirty blankets and thought that she would rather not be alive anymore. She recalled something she’d once heard: when people die, the first thing we forget is the sound of their voice. She did not want to forget her mother’s voice. So she tried to summon up her mother asking her if she’d cleaned her bedroom, or waking her by singing “Oh, What a Beautiful Morning”—a habit that used to drive Smart crazy. She remembered how her mother had consoled her after a popular girl at school invited others to a party right in front of her. Her mother had said, “There are only two opinions of you that really matter. One is God’s. And the other is mine. And don’t you know I will always love you, no matter what?” Smart decided that she’d endure whatever it took in order to see her family again.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Mitchell raped Smart daily. For the first three months, he chained her ankle to a cable strung between two trees. He warned her not to talk about her family, and declared that she could no longer call herself Elizabeth—she was Shearjashub now. Mitchell and Barzee had sex in front of her, and he made Smart look at pornography and drink alcohol, telling her that she had to descend to the depths before she could rise up and become pure again. She was often desperately hungry and thirsty, since they were dependent on what Mitchell called “plunder”—groceries that he shoplifted during treks to the city.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">After three months, Smart’s ordeal took a still stranger turn. Mitchell’s personal theology allowed him to indulge his appetites, and on his trips to Salt Lake City he satisfied cravings for beer and fast food. Barzee was resentful, and talked him into taking her and Smart with him. They began accompanying him to the city, shrouded in white robes, headdresses, and veils. The first time, they ended up at a party where Mitchell, in a robe and sandals, spent half the time preaching against sin and the rest drinking absinthe.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">These encounters with the outside world, in which Smart remained mute and compliant, are the most discomfiting part of her story. By then, her parents, the police, and hundreds of volunteers had been searching for her for months. Her photograph was on local billboards. But Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart walked around Salt Lake City in plain view. They took the bus, shopped at grocery stores, and spent time in parks.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">As Smart writes in “My Story,” their strange garb seemed to repel people who might otherwise have come closer or asked questions. Passersby crossed the street to avoid them. Smart remembers looking pleadingly at an older woman in the Salt Lake City Greyhound bus station, until the woman snapped at her, “What are you staring at? Don’t you know that’s rude! And why don’t you take that rag off your face!” Though Smart does not make this point in her book, self-styled prophets are not that rare in Salt Lake City, and although the Mormon Church long ago renounced polygamy, it is often tolerated at arm’s length in Utah. If local residents assumed that this particular street preacher had a couple of sister-wives in tow, they may not have considered the situation manifestly alarming.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart found it crushing to walk like a ghost through the city where she grew up, and she always reminds audiences not to be bystanders. She told the crowd in Washington, “What if, by one simple question, you saved a child’s life? Or if you were able to call the police and they were able to step in when a husband was beating his wife? Wouldn’t that be worth the slight discomfort you might feel, or the slight embarrassment if you were wrong?”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In Smart’s case, people did occasionally say something. At that party, a few girls managed to ask Smart how she was doing before Mitchell cut them off. One day at the downtown library, Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart were sitting at an out-of-the-way table on the second floor when a man came over and introduced himself as a homicide detective. Smart was “dizzy with hope and anticipation and gut-wrenching fear.” Under the table, Barzee’s hand clamped down on her leg. The fear won out. The detective asked them to remove Smart’s veil, noting that the police had received phone calls from people who were concerned that she might be a kidnapping victim. Mitchell calmly insisted that Smart was his daughter, and that his religion forbade him to reveal her face to a strange man. Smart couldn’t bring herself to speak. “Officer,” Mitchell said, “if she were the person you were looking for, why would she just sit there?” The detective left.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Mitchell gloated as they left the library. Smart writes, “It was maybe the lowest I had ever felt.” It’s clear from Smart’s memoir, and from those of other former captives, that incidents like this—in which an outsider asks questions but accepts dubious answers—are resoundingly significant. They confirm the captor’s sense of invincibility and the captive’s sense of invisibility.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In her book, Smart distinguishes such moments of terrified passivity from Stockholm syndrome—the idea that hostages sometimes become emotionally attached to their abductors. The term was coined, in 1973, by a Swedish criminologist who was trying to explain the behavior of four bank employees taken hostage in a robbery. During their six days in the bank, they had talked with the robbers, who had not harmed them. One hostage reported being more afraid of what police officers might do when they broke in. Since then, Stockholm syndrome has entered the parlance of pop psychology. No doubt, many hostages coöperate with their captors, or attempt to see their humanity. Some captives must sometimes feel a confusing rush of gratitude when they expect to be killed but aren’t, or yearn, in the midst of unimaginable isolation, to talk to somebody—even their kidnappers. (Jaycee Dugard, in her memoir, acknowledges sometimes needing the companionship of the man who imprisoned her—especially before she had her daughters.) There is very little published academic research on Stockholm syndrome, and it has never been included in the DSM.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart argues that you don’t need to have affection for a captor in order to be compliant—fear is enough. Throughout her captivity, she was afraid for her life and for her family; Mitchell frequently threatened to kill her, or them, if she screamed or ran away. As Smart knew, Mitchell didn’t make idle threats: he told her that he once threw his own mother down a flight of stairs, prompting her to file a restraining order; while he was holding Smart captive, he tried, unsuccessfully, to kidnap a young cousin of hers. “My Story” goes a long way toward explaining how Mitchell’s intimidation left Smart feeling hollowed out and paralyzed. “I am the living dead,” she writes. “I am nothing but a shell.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">David Finkelhor, a sociologist who directs the Crimes Against Children Research Center, at the University of New Hampshire, told me that he found Smart’s critique of Stockholm syndrome persuasive: “She’s right—fear and intimidation explain a lot more.” Natascha Kampusch, in “3,096 Days in Captivity,” writes that the Stockholm-syndrome diagnosis “turns victims into victims a second time, by taking from them the power to interpret their own story—and by turning the most significant experiences from their story into the product of a syndrome. The term places the very behavior that contributes significantly to the victim’s survival that much closer to being objectionable. Getting closer to the kidnapper is not an illness. Creating a cocoon of normality within the framework of a crime is not a syndrome.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In September, 2003, three and a half months after the abduction, Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart took a Greyhound bus to California. Mitchell left the women in a desolate campsite near San Diego, but brought them into town to eat at free dinners for the homeless.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">During this period, Mitchell became an official suspect. Mary Katherine Smart had not, in fact, been asleep that night. After Smart’s abduction, her sister lay in bed for hours, petrified. She finally went to her parents’ bedroom and said, “Elizabeth is gone. You won’t find her. A man came and took her.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Whenever Smart talks about Mary Katherine, she stresses the courage it required for her sister to get out of bed, not how long it took. As Smart notes in her memoir, “Mary Katherine was a child who had just had the most traumatic experience of her life.” After Elizabeth had been missing for a few months, Mary Katherine told her parents that she thought the kidnapper was the beggar who had worked on their roof.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart subsisted in San Diego through the holidays, and one day in February Mitchell announced that they needed to move to a faraway city, like New York, Boston, or Philadelphia. Smart decided that her only chance lay in getting back to Salt Lake City, where someone might recognize her. She flattered Mitchell, telling him that, whereas God had never spoken to her, Mitchell was “practically His best friend.” She had a feeling that they should go back to Salt Lake—could he please ask God if she was right? Before long, he told her that Salt Lake City was their next destination. As she says in her speeches, “Maybe that stroked his ego the right way. Maybe he thought, My little Shearjashub is finally getting it.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">This spring, in the Times, the literary critic Elaine Showalter compared the memoirs written by modern kidnapping survivors to the narratives of white women captured by Native Americans, which fascinated American readers from the seventeenth century through the nineteenth. These tracts of suffering and redemption had a religious purpose, but they were also portrayals of female fortitude and resourcefulness. Of all the modern kidnapping books, Smart’s memoir is most reminiscent of these tales. “My Story” frequently invokes God and Smart’s faith, and she describes one incident as a miracle: at a time when she was nearly mad from thirst, a cup of water inexplicably appeared by her pillow. Smart and her captors hitchhiked back to Salt Lake City, and she describes walking for miles along barren stretches of desert roads, not unlike the frontier women who trekked with Native American tribes after being abducted in raids. Mitchell let Smart forgo the robe and the veil in the desert, but he made her wear what Smart calls an “old-lady gray hair bubble.” They trudged along until they were out of water and down to their last provisions: old carrots in vinegar, a can of black olives. Smart writes, “By noon, I was starting to believe we were committing suicide by thirst.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart had to summon tremendous physical stamina to survive her captivity. Not all girls her age would have had such strength. She told me that she had been athletic as a kid: she had been a runner, and had ridden horses in the Wasatch Mountains. “I was no body-builder, but I was no weakling, either,” she recalls.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">On March 12, 2003, Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart arrived in a suburb of Salt Lake City. Mitchell vowed to hide Smart for good in the Wasatch Mountains. But as they walked up State Street, which led into the city, three police cars surrounded them. Passersby had noticed them and made a connection to the missing Elizabeth Smart. Once again, Mitchell coolly deflected the cops, and Smart didn’t speak. Finally, one officer told the others, “She’s too scared to even answer. You’ve got to get her by herself.” Separated from Mitchell and Barzee, Smart finally revealed who she was.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">She was put into a police car. “What’s going to happen to them?” Smart asked the officer in the car. She could tell by his expression that he thought she was expressing concern for her captors—and that’s the way it was sometimes reported. Smart says that she was really trying to find out if she’d end up in the same room with Mitchell at the police station.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In fact, Smart did not see Mitchell again until his trial, seven years later. His lawyers had pursued an insanity plea, and it took that long to establish that Mitchell was competent to stand trial. By then, Smart had graduated from high school and begun working on a music degree, at Brigham Young University. (She later put her studies on hold in order to do advocacy work.) Smart also served as a Mormon missionary, in Paris, where she met her future husband, Matthew Gilmour, a Mormon from Scotland. He is a private person, and their mutual friends warned him that Smart was famous in the States, but he was not deterred. “Once he makes up his mind about something, it’s like going up against a brick wall,” Smart told me, smiling. “It can be very frustrating, but if he’s your friend there’s no one more loyal. He’ll never abandon a friend, especially one who needs his help.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In December, 2010, a jury found Mitchell guilty on felony counts of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for the purpose of sex. He received a life sentence. Barzee, who had agreed to testify against him in a plea bargain, had already been sentenced to fifteen years. At Mitchell’s trial, during which he frequently sang hymns in the courtroom, Smart testified in graphic detail without becoming visibly rattled. Occasionally, she was even a bit arch. She revealed that she once dissuaded Mitchell from raping her by reminding him of his marital duties to Barzee. When her lawyer asked her to describe her feelings at the time, she replied, “One for the Smart team.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">This summer, I visited Smart in Park City, the Utah ski town, where she and her husband live in a small condo. At the time, Gilmour was in Scotland, seeing family, but Smart wasn’t alone—she had a new puppy, a first-anniversary gift from him.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">On the cover of her memoir, Smart, in a peach-colored sweater, is bathed in a gauzy light, her hair shining, and in person she didn’t look much different. In Park City and on the other occasions that we met, she wore crisp business-casual clothes that had girlish splashes of color or pattern. It was as though she had resolved never to look grubby again. Indeed, part of what audiences seemed to like about her was that she never did. It wasn’t quite fair, but Smart’s Breck-girl beauty had been part of what fascinated people about her kidnapping, and now that beauty seemed to confirm her triumph as a survivor.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">We talked about the radKIDS self-defense classes, which are open to children in preschool through sixth grade. Smart cited a study, conducted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, that looked at seven thousand failed abductions of children—mostly girls between the ages of ten and fourteen. Eighty-one per cent of the time, the attempt was foiled by kids running away, yelling, or kicking. David Finkelhor, the sociologist, emphasized that some incidents that are classified as attempted abduction do not involve force. Still, he said, “Most people in the field would agree that, when kids say no and resist, it’s usually successful.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart told me that she wishes that she’d been trained to put up a fuss if someone tried to make her do something against her will. When I asked her if she thought that would have made a difference the night that Mitchell broke into her house, she said, “Yes, but I’ll never know. Because I never had that training.” She went through the radKIDS program herself shortly after returning home, and said that she felt safer, and more powerful, as a result. She had a story that was “maybe a little silly,” but made her point. As a college freshman, she’d been walking around the B.Y.U. campus with a guy she was dating, and a friend warned her that somebody in a scary clown mask was menacing other students. “So this kid with the mask did come up to us, and he got closer and closer to me,” she said. “The guy I was with wasn’t doing anything. And, well, I just don’t take risks anymore. So I said, ‘If you come one step closer, I’m going to kick you right where it counts.’ And he took one step closer. And, because of my training, I felt empowered to kick him. He left me alone after that.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In her speeches, Smart reminds audiences of the need to watch out for one another and to report abuse when we suspect it, often observing that she was saved by whoever called the police in that suburb of Salt Lake City. After a talk, several people usually come up to her to say that they, too, were abused when they were young. Often, they tell her that she’s the first person they’ve confided in. Smart responds that she’s honored by their trust, but they must tell the authorities, too, because the person who hurt them is probably hurting someone else.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart always tells audiences about the “best advice” she has ever received. When she came home, her mother said to her, “Elizabeth, what this man has done is terrible. There aren’t any words that are strong enough to describe how wicked and evil he is! He has taken nine months of your life that you will never get back again. But the best punishment you could ever give him is to be happy. To move forward with your life. To do exactly what you want.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">This counsel might seem overly optimistic, even unrealistic. Smart had an unusually supportive family that did not come apart under the stress of her abduction—even after they became criminal suspects for a time, as family members often do in such cases. Someone in Salt Lake City who knows the Smarts told me, “They are a prominent Mormon family, and a very tight one. Her family and her community folded her right back in.” Smart remains close to all her relatives, and on the legislative issues she has lobbied for—like the national registry for sex offenders—she often works with her father, a former real-estate agent who now owns a furniture store.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart’s return to emotional health may also be tied to the fact that Mitchell was, basically, a stranger. Most victims of sexual crimes are harmed by family members and acquaintances, and this violation of trust can be permanently debilitating. In “My Story,” Smart writes about how lucky she is that her abusers are forever out of her life: “I don’t have to go home every night and see them, or see pictures of them hanging on the wall, or know that, even though my family is so upset with what they might have done to me, there is still a piece of their hearts that cares and loves the abusers because they are their children, or parents, or brothers and sisters.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In our conversations, Smart emphasized that there is no right way to recover after a trauma like hers. She did not seek therapy, finding solace instead in playing the harp and in riding horses with her grandfather, an oncologist who died in 2006. She started high school the fall after she returned home, and graduated on schedule. “My parents were really good at resuming a normal routine, not singling me out, saying, ‘Oh, Elizabeth can’t do this or that anymore.’ ” Her parents also made it clear that if she wanted any kind of counselling or medication she would get it. Smart thinks that therapy is a good option for many people, and she has offered counsel to other victims—“some high profile, some nobody’s ever heard of.” But she would “never presume, never go out and push myself forward, because privacy and finding your own way are so precious.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Smart’s greatest appeal as a public figure is her evident desire not to judge other women. Kristine Haglund, the editor of a journal about Mormonism, told me, “The interesting thing is that she is almost universally admired. Which is a tough thing for a Mormon woman to pull off. She had this terrible experience, and one that had weird and creepy Mormon overtones. Yet she still believes. She’s entirely faithful. And while she’s not part of the feminist ferment in Mormonism, and I doubt she’d call herself a feminist, she is strong in a way that feminists can admire. She emerged strong and whole, a modern woman able to address questions of sexuality directly and confidently.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">While I was in Park City, I joined Smart at a chamber-music concert there. Mary Katherine was also attending. I had been warned that Mary Katherine, who is twenty-one, didn’t much like reporters, and I couldn’t blame her. In “My Story,” Elizabeth describes being pestered with questions about why Mary Katherine had “delayed” telling her parents about the kidnapping. But Mary Katherine greeted me politely, looking ever so slightly skeptical, then turned to her sister and shared her admiration for a violinist who was playing that night.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">At Mitchell’s trial, an attorney had asked Mary Katherine what she was interested in when she was nine, and she began her answer by saying, “I was into hanging out with my sister.” In Park City, it was clear that they are still close. During Debussy’s Violin Sonata in G-Minor, they sat side by side, their enviable posture nearly identical, occasionally glancing down at the same program. At intermission, Elizabeth noted that Mary Katherine was working with disabled children while pursuing a major in special education. Elizabeth, who still plans to get her degree, joked, “She’s going to finish college before I am.” Mary Katherine plays the harp, too, and they had both had a job playing in the lobby of a Salt Lake City hotel. Mary Katherine laughed when Elizabeth mentioned the time that she received a compliment on her music from an unlikely source: Gene Simmons, of Kiss, who was a guest at the hotel.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Elizabeth asked Mary Katherine about a guy she’d been seeing.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Oh, I’m through with boys,” she declared, airily.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">“Oh, I see,” Elizabeth said. “Well, just don’t have too many preconceived ideas. I always thought I’d fall for a guy who was six foot five and definitely out of school. And Matthew is, like, an inch taller than me, weighs about the same, and is still a student.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Outside, the sky was turning ochre and pink. It had been hot and dry all day, but we were feeling that agreeable chill which comes just after the sun goes down in the mountain West. The sisters linked arms and walked back inside the concert hall.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Earlier, I had asked Elizabeth if she ever thought about what she would be doing had she not been abducted. “I wouldn’t be human if I didn’t,” she replied, then admitted that she couldn’t fully picture an alternative life. Certainly she wouldn’t be speaking out about rape and abuse. Because of the abduction, she noted, “I’m a stronger person than I would have been.” She paused. “I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, though. I don’t think anybody needs to become strong that way.”</p></div>
