<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">UPTOWN, DOWNTOWN</p><br/><p class="no-indent">The gap between Broadway and Off Broadway sensibilities.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">THE NOTION THAT THEATRE is universal is specious, given the world of difference that can separate the productions in New York’s uptown and downtown theatres. In the nineteen-fifties, Off Broadway established itself in legendary downtown venues such as the Theatre de Lys and the Orpheum, and with shows as diverse as Marc Blitzstein’s version of Brecht and Weill’s “Threepenny Opera” and the composer Rick Besoyan’s “Little Mary Sunshine.” (Judith Malina and the Living Theatre had been doing it their own way, and brilliantly, since 1947, but they were so far out that they were beyond the reach of capitalism.) Since then, theatres below Fourteenth Street have generally been where you go to get away from the commercialism of the Broadway stage, which, traditionally, plays to our desire to be satiated and amused. But the gap between Broadway’s push to entertain and Off Broadway’s presumably more considered take on the world is getting smaller. (For instance, Gabriel Kahane’s “February House,” at the Public last year, despite two lovely tunes, couldn’t decide if it was a musicale about queerness, or a queer “With Six You Get Eggroll.”) This is largely because many contemporary American performers play to their audience’s desire to be bludgeoned by obvious emotion, no matter how serious the text; it’s rare that a performer above or below Fourteenth Street doesn’t infuse a part with Nathan Lane-like show-offy sparkle and distress.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">In the latest new musical to open on Broadway, “Big Fish” (at the Neil Simon), Norbert Leo Butz, as the dying Edward Bloom, tries to avoid the kitsch of the director Susan Stroman’s vision by performing in a naturalistic, easygoing style, but his looseness only emphasizes the glutted nature of the production. The musical’s big themes of life and death are underlined with big, Julie Taymor-influenced sets, and Stroman trivializes not only the Gordian blood knot that binds sons to their fathers but also death. If dying resembles all the Technicolor feelings and costumes that Stroman stuffs the stage with, maybe croaking’s not so bad. David Leveaux’s current Broadway revival of “Romeo and Juliet” (at the Richard Rodgers) also shares a strange aversion to the despair we feel about mortality. Instead of working toward the grief we should feel at the end of the play, the director makes it all about racial harmony as one sweet swirl.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Death and the father are the themes that shape Lisa Kron and composer Jeanine Tesori’s musical adaptation of Alison Bechdel’s exceptional 2006 graphic memoir, “Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic” (Off Broadway, at the Public Theatre). Set in rural Pennsylvania, the story revolves around Bechdel’s coming of age as a young lesbian in a home where difference was simply not discussed. There’s a reason for that: Bechdel’s father was gay, and his avoidance of that fact makes the narrative both tragic and real. Bechdel, with her butch haircut and demeanor, became the queer son her father could never openly be. With this level of seriousness, Kron and Tesori are drawing a line between their work and those productions that play too patently into being uptown show-stoppy or downtown “transgressive.” Instead, they’re aiming to showcase what we all share in: the exigencies of being human.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">—Hilton Als</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">OPENINGS AND PREVIEWS </p><br/><p class="no-indent">After Midnight </p><p class="no-indent">Warren Carlyle directs and choreographs this musical, which reimagines the shows of the Cotton Club.

Previews begin Oct. 18. (Playwrights Horizons, 416 W. 42nd St. 212-279-4200.)</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">NOW PLAYING </p><br/><p class="no-indent">And Miles to Go </p><p class="no-indent">Chad Beckim’s small, well-written drama depicts a morning at a New York City public high school on the verge of closing, when Miss Adele Priam (Randy Danson), a passionate teacher and a forty-year veteran of the school, struggles with the school board, the principal (Maria-Christina Oliveras), three particularly badly behaved students (Devika Bhise, Keona Welch, and Gabe Millman), and the spectre of an assassin who enters the school and starts killing people. The play is about the humanity that arises in people when their complacency—and their selfishness and stupidity—is suddenly obliterated by terrifying violence. Though Beckim’s play could use a less abrupt ending, the action, under the direction of Hal Brooks, is riveting, and the acting so convincing you feel like it’s actually happening. (The Wild Project, 195 E. 3rd St. 212-352-3101.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Anthem In </p><p class="no-indent">Jeff Britting’s adaptation of Ayn Rand’s 1938 science-fiction novella, Equality 7-2521 (Matthew Lieff Christian), a brilliant young street sweeper, is raised in a Middle Ages-style, postapocalyptic society so totalitarian that it has stripped human beings of their individuality. Equality finds himself wanting a job more suitable for someone of his intellect, and pining for Liberty (Sofia Lauwers), the girl who plants seeds near his office. When, in secret, he invents light, he’s sure that he’ll be invited into the “Council of Scholars,” but instead he’s sentenced to death for his hubris. The best thing about this slick, multimedia production, directed by Austin Shakespeare’s artistic director, Ann Ciccolella, is Christian’s performance—when he has a rebel thought, he seems utterly surprised. Against the drab backdrop of the rest of the play, he is fully alive. (Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 W. 37th St. 866-811-4111.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Big Fish </p><p class="no-indent">Susan Stroman directs and choreographs this steroid-heavy, pointless adaptation of the 2003 Tim Burton movie, with a book by John August and music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa. Will Bloom (the adorable Bobby Steggert), newly married, finds out that his father, Edward (the natural Norbert Leo Butz), is sick, and begins looking back at the myths and realities of the old man’s life. As Edward is dying, Will and his wife, Josephine (the fine actress Krystal Joy Brown, whose character doesn’t seem particularly disturbed that she’s the only black person in an all-white Southern world), are waiting for the birth of their child. Life and death are inextricably intertwined, just as the musical’s big themes are bound up with outsized sets, such as a row of dancing elephants, seen from behind, and a giant who cleans up nice. (Neil Simon, 250 W. 52nd St. 877-250-2929.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Bronx Bombers</p><p class="no-indent">The writer and director Eric Simonson (“Lombardi,” “Magic/Bird”) partners with Major League Baseball and the New York Yankees. Simonson makes Yogi Berra (Richard Topol) the central figure, but the old catcher is really just a vehicle around which to spin the playwright’s hagiography of a storied franchise. Eventually, Berra is thrown into a “Field of Dreams”-like state, in which Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle, and others show up for a team dinner. Fans may enjoy seeing their heroes parading in pinstripes, rehearsing hoary bits of Yankee lore, but theatre lovers will have to look elsewhere for a well-executed play. (The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 W. 42nd St. 646-223-3010. Through Oct. 19.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Julius Caesar </p><p class="no-indent">The director Phyllida Lloyd has created a plausible, all-female “Julius Caesar” (which played first at London’s Donmar Warehouse) by setting her play in a contemporary women’s prison and having its inmates put on the Shakespeare work. The effect is that Brutus (the brilliant Harriet Walter) and Cassius (Jenny Junes)—who plot to kill their friend Julius Caesar (Frances Barber) because they fear what direction his ambition will take when he becomes king—are tougher than most men, and yet they have a vulnerability that male actors wouldn’t necessarily bring to the tragedy. Add to this emotional depth and a punk-rock ambience—complete with a thrash-punk band; flashing, glaring lights; a clanging metal set; and costumes the Artful Dodger would’ve loved—and you’ve got a great show. (St. Ann’s Warehouse, 29 Jay St., Brooklyn. 718-254-8779.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">A Night with Janis Joplin </p><p class="no-indent">The writer and director of this jukebox musical, Randy Johnson, focusses on Joplin’s development as a blues singer. Thus Joplin—the glorious Mary Bridget Davies—tells her life story, and sings, and cites the singers who inspired her, including Bessie Smith (Taprena Michelle Augustine) and Nina Simone (de’Adre Aziza). They sing, too; they’re knockouts. But they stick around after Joplin joins Big Brother and the Holding Company, and the Joplin narrative trails off. Thus we get Odetta but no Pigpen; Aretha but no Woodstock; Etta James but no San Francisco beyond the Haight-Ashbury sign. (And no heroin overdose—Joplin’s death is implied by the song “I’m Gonna Rock My Way to Heaven.”) The show’s emphasis backfires a bit, minimizing Joplin’s own story while unwittingly making her heroes seem like stepping stones. But Davies’s performance of “Piece of My Heart” and other classics is undeniably thrilling. (Lyceum, 149 W. 45th St. 212-239-6200.)</p></div>
