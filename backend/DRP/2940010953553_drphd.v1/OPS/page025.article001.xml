<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">ROCK AND POP</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Musicians and night-club proprietors lead complicated lives; it’s advisable to check in advance to confirm engagements.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Fiona Apple and Blake Mills </p><p class="no-indent">Traditionally, the woman is the muse to the man, but in the case of these two, there’s a sense of a delightful role reversal at play. Mills, a singer-songwriter in his own right, who goes for a rootsy, ethereal vibe, served as both the supporting act and guitarist during Apple’s tour for her 2012 album, “The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do.” This month, the pair are on the road together, with a collaborative set, “Anything We Want: An Evening with Fiona Apple and Blake Mills.” They are performing from their respective catalogues, along with original, yet to be released material. The duo has stated that it has only “26% of an idea of what the fuck we will be playing,” but for fans of the tempestuous Apple, an evening of the unexpected is always somewhat expected. (Beacon Theatre, Broadway at 74th St. 212-465-6500. Oct. 21-22.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">CMJ Music Marathon </p><p class="no-indent">Don’t be surprised if you see an abundance of discarded business cards littering Lower Manhattan—New York’s annual music-industry meet-and-greet is in full swing. This year’s gathering has an unusually strong roster; the challenge will be hearing the next big thing over the hum of networking. The lineup features hip-hop (Talib Kweli, Riff Raff), heavy metal (Nachtmystium, Godflesh), and the recent grunge revival (Yuck, Speedy Ortiz), along with the requisite program of apocalyptic panels designed to scare N.Y.U. students out of applying for A. &amp; R. internships. (cmj.com. Oct. 15-19.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Janelle Monáe </p><p class="no-indent">A hardworking singer-songwriter who grew up in Kansas City, moved to Atlanta, and entered the orbits of Outkast and then Sean Combs, Monáe emerged in 2010 with an acclaimed début album, “The ArchAndroid,” which combined elements of science fiction, classical composition, and old-fashioned soul singing. Her follow-up release, “Electric Lady,” came out last month and includes appearances by Solange Knowles, Erykah Badu, Esperanza Spalding, and Prince. Monáe’s songs exist at the rare intersection between conceptual daring and satisfying traditionalism. She’s the thinking person’s funk star. (Apollo Theatre, 253 W. 125th St. 800-745-3000. Oct. 18.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Savages </p><p class="no-indent">There is something undeniably powerful about this London group, which leaves no doubt about their name. The all-female band’s rapid, abrasive guitar playing and caustic rhythm section provide an artful and often brutal backdrop to their anthem-like vocals, which are delivered with the speed of punk rock and the solemnity of religious hymns. Their début album, “Silence Yourself,” released earlier this year, is a grim and energetic blast. They’re paired with Duke Garwood, who plays beautiful blues guitar with a pinch of grunge. (Terminal 5, 610 W. 56th St. 212-582-6600. Oct. 16.)</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">JAZZ AND STANDARDS </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Judy Collins </p><p class="no-indent">The sixties icon, who is seventy-four, sounds terrific and, as her witty and wise stage patter attests, has weathered the emotional, romantic, and social upheavals of the ensuing decades with style, her sanity intact. She continues to bring interpretative life to gems by such titans as Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, songwriters that Collins helped establish in the public eye, as well as her own choice originals. (Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, Madison Ave. at 76th St. 212-744-1600. Oct. 15-26.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Tom Harrell </p><p class="no-indent">Last week, the hard-blowing trumpeter led his customary quintet, and the second week of this prestigious engagement finds him fronting his leaner Trip ensemble. It includes the influential tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, whose smartly conceived improvisations deftly balance lyricism and rigor. Trip’s Ugonna Okegwo, on bass, and Adam Cruz, on drums, will set the horn players off in kinetic splendor. (Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Ave. S., at 11th St. 212-255-4037. Oct. 15-20.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Charles McPherson </p><p class="no-indent">When the great alto saxophonist was a budding teen-age musician, in the mid-fifties, Charlie Parker was still alive and actively casting his shadow over the entire jazz scene. McPherson later incorporated hard-and post-bop practices into his playing—as heard in his sporadic but memorable stints with Charles Mingus—but he still retains plenty of Bird in his playing, and it’s an unalloyed joy to hear. The forthright trumpeter Brian Lynch will be McPherson’s front-line foil in his quintet, which includes Jeb Patton, on piano, Kiyoshi Kitagawa, on bass, and Jonathan Blake, on drums. (Jazz Standard, 116 E. 27th St. 212-576-2232. Oct. 17-20.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Wilson/Rosnes/Washington Trio </p><p class="no-indent">The pianist Renee Rosnes has long led ensembles powered by a drummer, as convention befits. Lately, though, she’s joined forces with two longtime associates, the saxophonist Steve Wilson and the bassist Peter Washington, in a coöperative trio that generates plenty of swing even without a percussionist. For this adroit chamber-jazz ensemble, less equals a great deal more. (Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Broadway at 60th St. 212-258-9595. Oct. 18-20.)</p></div>
