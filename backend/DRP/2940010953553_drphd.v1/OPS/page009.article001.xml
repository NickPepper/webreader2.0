<div class="articleImageCredit" id="ImageCredit">ILLUSTRATION BY AL HIRSCHFELD</div>
<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">AL HIRSCHFELD (pictured in a self-portrait from 1980) began his career in motion pictures, but soon turned to Broadway, and, over the next eight decades, became an icon with his trademark swooping-line drawings. An ardent playgoer (his namesake theatre currently houses “Kinky Boots”), Hirschfeld specialized in drawing show-biz folks. Though he’s often labelled a caricaturist, his work conveys respect as well as capturing the essence of a performer’s virtuosity. He drew (including for this magazine) until his death, in 2003, six months before his hundredth birthday. This week, “The Line King’s Library,” a rich and glamorous history of twentieth-century theatre, opens at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.</p></div>
