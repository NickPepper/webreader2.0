<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">BRIDGET JONES: MAD ABOUT THE BOY, by Helen Fielding (Knopf). In the weeks leading up to this book’s publication, fans were treated to some distressing revelations: Mark Darcy has been killed by a land mine in Sudan, leaving Bridget, aged fifty-one, to bring up the couple’s two children. At the start of the book, the family is infected with head lice. Later, Bridget finds a lover almost half her age, gets confused by the multiple remotes for the TV, and is perpetually late getting the kids to school. The novel has tender and comic moments, but there are cringe-inducing ones, too, as when characters say “You go, Girl!” unironically. The original Bridget Jones launched a genre because she captured the zeitgeist; in midlife, she feels interchangeable with the characters of Fielding’s many imitators.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">SUBTLE BODIES, by Norman Rush (Knopf). Rush’s third novel is slighter than its brilliant predecessors “Mating” and “Mortals,” but has many of the qualities that define his best work. It is an intimate portrait of a couple, Ned and Nina, three years married and trying to conceive a baby. They arrive in the Catskills to mourn the death of Ned’s friend Douglas, and end up in tough, sprawling conversations about politics and life with his estranged pals. Rush gestures toward a traditional plot at various points, but most of the important events turn out to have taken place before the novel’s opening. What resonates most vividly is Nina’s fierce, idiosyncratic love. “I am your friend, you idiot,” she thinks, “and I let you into my perfect body, for Christ’s sake.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">THE UNKNOWNS, by Gabriel Roth (Reagan Arthur). This début novel charts the emotional evolution of Eric Muller, a young computer programmer who has emerged a multimillionaire from the millennial dot-com bubble. Programming comes naturally to Eric, but social relations do not: he tries to parse human interaction like lines of code, timing his movements at parties down to the minute. His strategy pays off, and he gets a girlfriend, but her psychological problems overshadow his attainment and, to some extent, the book’s plot. The acuity of Eric’s social observations provides some very funny moments, but Roth is at his finest in flashback chapters that depict Eric as a painfully hopeless adolescent.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">GO GIANTS, by Nick Laird (Norton). “You’re beeswax and I’m birdshit,” the first poem in this collection begins, and the book celebrates the jagged coexistence of the glorious and the mundane, the classical and the contemporary, the whimsical and the deadly serious. “The Mission” takes place in a revival tent in gritty Northern Ireland, amid “concrete slabs and a muddy lawn”; “The Mark” considers “pavonazzetto” sculptures at the Capitoline Museum, in Rome, and the virtues of music produced on lyres versus reed flutes. Poems such as “Spree” play with language (“The gardener mown down. The typist erased. / The postman dispatched and the vet put to sleep”). The range of these scrupulous poems suggests that there is little in form or content that Laird cannot master.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">FALLING UPWARDS, by Richard Holmes (Pantheon). Balloons preceded trains by several decades and airplanes by more than a century. In 1862, the English meteorologist James Glaisher discovered the extent of the breathable atmosphere by ascending in a balloon until he passed out. In 1870, the French broke the Prussian siege of Paris by sending out men, along with bags of mail, in balloons. In this quirky account, Holmes mixes historical anecdotes with more personal asides. He celebrates “the mental release, the physical heart-lift, the calm perilous delight of ballooning.” As well as offering new opportunities in science, transportation, entertainment, and exploration, balloons, Holmes argues, ushered in “a new kind of sublime.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">RETURN OF A KING, by William Dalrymple (Knopf). In the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-42), British troops were cut down or froze to death in the snow around Kabul. The legend that there was only a single survivor is not quite true, Dalrymple writes in this history, but it was close. He tells the story with cinematic precision, using long-ignored Afghan sources, in which the British often appear less tragic than absurd. When more British troops arrived the next spring, they passed great piles of stripped, unburied corpses. “What we are staying here for I am utterly at a loss to know,” General William Nott wrote, “unless it be to be laughed at by the Afghans and the whole world.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">O MY AMERICA!, by Sara Wheeler (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux). Facing fifty and finding a dearth of good literature dealing with the “last gray chapters of female lives,” Wheeler decided to reënact the American journeys of six British women who crossed the pond in the mid-nineteenth century in search of second acts. Fanny Trollope (Anthony’s mother) writes a best-selling book on American manners; Fanny Kemble, witnessing the horrors of slavery in the South, helps sway England to the abolitionist cause; Isabella Bird crosses the Rockies and becomes the first female fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Wheeler subtly uses the uncharted territory of early America as a metaphor for life’s final frontiers, and she describes hauntingly the natural world in which she and her heroines find “a kind of transfiguration.”</p><br/><p class="no-indent">VANITY FAIR: 100 YEARS, edited by Graydon Carter (Abrams). This lavish book opens with an image of Kate Moss adopting a Marlene Dietrich pose—a cunning allusion to Vanity Fair’s bifurcated history. (It ran from 1913 to 1936, became a casualty of the Depression, and was revived in 1983.) Carter’s introduction identifies “a tone, a style of writing, a form of humor, and a stance toward the culture” that bind these two eras of the magazine together. The Jazz Age product moves to the rhythms of its pop-Cubist illustrations, especially in the matchless work of Miguel Covarrubias. The latter period is the age of Annie Leibovitz; one spread celebrates the hundred and sixty-six covers she has produced so far. Wandering over so many iconic images of the famous, the eye is drawn to people for whom celebrity never quite happened—like Alice White or Judith Wood—and who are captured in their brief moment of beauty and promise.</p></div>
