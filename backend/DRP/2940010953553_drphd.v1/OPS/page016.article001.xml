<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">OPERA </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Metropolitan Opera </p><p class="no-indent">At last it arrives: Nico Muhly’s “Two Boys,” the only opera to appear on the Met’s stage from the new-works initiative that Peter Gelb (with André Bishop) spearheaded when he took over, in 2006. Back then Muhly was a hot ticket; now he’s a prolific, seasoned pro, whose style ineffably blends Philip Glass minimalism with the contrapuntal mysteries of the English Renaissance, among other influences. This opera, with a libretto by Craig Lucas, is based upon a true-crime incident in Britain, the stabbing of one boy by another; the two met on the Web, and several scenes take place in cyberspace, which should make for some dazzling visuals. Revised since its début production at English National Opera in 2011, it stars Paul Appleby and Christopher Bolduc as the teen-age protagonists, with Alice Coote in the “Prime Suspect”-like role of a police detective; David Robertson conducts a production by Bartlett Sher. (Oct. 21 at 8. Note: (Le) Poisson Rouge will offer two shows featuring music by Muhly and Benjamin Britten, with Davies and Patricia Racette, on Oct. 17. lprnyc.com.) • Also playing: Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin,” in the new Deborah Warner production, features Anna Netrebko, Mariusz Kwiecien, and Piotr Beczala; Pavel Smelkov conducts. (Oct. 16 at 7:30 and Oct. 19 at 8.) • William Kentridge’s riotously inventive production of Shostakovich’s “The Nose” (based on the Gogol story) returns with two of its original stars, Paulo Szot and Andrey Popov; Smelkov. (Oct. 17 and Oct. 22 at 7:30.) • The powerhouse soprano Sondra Radvanovsky proves herself worthy of the challenge of the title role of Bellini’s “Norma,” embodying the Druid priestess’s trusting vulnerability and eruptive temper and unleashing impressive high notes, with strong support from Aleksandrs Antonenko as a heroic Pollione; Riccardo Frizza. (Oct. 18 at 7:30.) • The estimable James Conlon conducts a promising young cast (including such standouts as Iestyn Davies, Kathleen Kim, and Joseph Kaiser) in Benjamin Britten’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” a strangely compelling spin on the Shakespeare original, in a revival of Tim Albery’s fine production. (Oct. 19 at 1.) (Metropolitan Opera House. 212-362-6000.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Amore Opera: “The Magic Flute” and “Das Labyrinth” </p><p class="no-indent">New York City Opera is dead, but smaller groups like Amore endure. The feisty company’s current endeavor is to run Mozart’s beloved classic in repertory with Peter von Winter’s sequel, from 1798 (which received its first modern revival last season at the Salzburg Festival), making its U.S. début; the two works have the same librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder. (Connelly Theatre, 220 E. 4th St. Through Oct. 27. For performance details, see amoreopera.org.)</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">ORCHESTRAS AND CHORUSES </p><br/><p class="no-indent">New York Philharmonic </p><p class="no-indent">With Alan Gilbert conducting the Juilliard Orchestra at Carnegie Hall this week, the podium at Avery Fisher Hall belongs to Semyon Bychkov. The exceptional young pianist Kirill Gerstein makes his Philharmonic subscription début in a program featuring two Russian works on the extremes of the expressive spectrum: Rachmaninoff’s terse and witty Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini and Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 11, “The Year 1905,” a big, broad-brush newsreel of a piece marking tsarist Russia’s first rumblings of revolution. (212-875-5656. Oct. 17 at 7:30, Oct. 18 at 2, and Oct. 19 at 8.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">London Symphony Orchestra </p><p class="no-indent">The venerable Bernard Haitink conducts the sterling orchestra, and Mozart and Shostakovich are on the menu, with the first concert offering Mozart’s sunny Piano Concerto No. 9 in E-Flat Major and Shostakovich’s roiling Fourth Symphony and the second featuring two products of each composer’s final years, the wondrously mature Concerto No. 27 in B-Flat Major and the mysterious Fifteenth Symphony. Each is enriched by the presence of Emanuel Ax—just back from the Twin Cities, where he performed in Osmo Vänskä’s farewell concerts with the Minnesota Orchestra. (Avery Fisher Hall. 212-721-6500. Oct. 20 at 3 and Oct. 21 at 8.)</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">RECITALS </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Silk Road Ensemble </p><p class="no-indent">Yo-Yo Ma’s travelling ensemble of classical and world-music players is a constant presence in the musical landscape, even if its New York concerts are infrequent. They come to Carnegie with a vibrant mix of works, including the local premières of pieces by John Zorn (a suite from “Book of Angels”), David Bruce, and the recently minted MacArthur fellow Vijay Iyer (“Playlist for an Extreme Occasion”). (212-247-7800. Oct. 16 at 8.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center </p><p class="no-indent">The Society, joining the season fashionably late, arrives this week with two programs, both on its home turf, Alice Tully Hall. Opening night verges on orchestral grandeur, a seventeen-player “Strings Celebration” that offers works by Bartók, Mendelssohn, and Tchaikovsky (the eternal Serenade for Strings); the second, featuring the pianists Gilbert Kalish and Orion Weiss, is devoted to the art of the piano quartet, heard in examples by Mozart (in E-Flat Major, K. 493), Turina, and Brahms (No. 2 in A Major). (212-875-5788. Oct. 17 at 7:30, Oct. 20 at 5, and Oct. 22 at 7:30.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Miller Theatre </p><p class="no-indent">Columbia University’s dynamic performance series embraces the new and the old this week. Oct. 17 at 8: Richard Carrick’s Either/Or ensemble offers a tribute to John Cage, with a group of a hundred and twenty-five composers (including William Bolcom, David T. Little, and Keeril Makan) providing a kind of conga line of tiny pieces, each written to connect with one another in time-honored Surrealist fashion. • Oct. 19 at 8: Le Poème Harmonique, a superb French group of singers and players popular at the house, returns to present a concert centered on Monteverdi’s sublimely expressive “Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda,” which also includes works by Marazzoli and Il Fasolo. (Broadway at 116th St. 212-854-7799.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Bargemusic </p><p class="no-indent">Ned Rorem, New York’s enduring master of lyrical music, will soon be ninety. The clarinettist Thomas Piercy, the violinist Harumi Rhodes, and the pianist Judith Olson pay tribute at the music barge, playing several of his works (including the infectiously jazzy “Picnic on the Marne”) as well as a series of celebratory short pieces by such composers as Jennifer Higdon and Daron Hagen. (Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn. Oct. 18 at 7. For tickets and full schedule, see bargemusic.org.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Valentina Lisitsa </p><p class="no-indent">For its official season opener, the 92nd Street Y is turning to classical vox pop: the Ukrainian-born pianist has built her substantial career through YouTube hits, and her program here has been selected by her fans via the Y’s Web site. With the exception of Shostakovich’s Sonata No. 2 in B Minor, it’s strictly repertory—a bushel of Rachmaninoff preludes and a clutch of Chopin nocturnes. (Lexington Ave. at 92nd St. 212-415-5500. Oct. 19 at 8.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Chris Thile </p><p class="no-indent">The young mandolin phenom divides his time between extending the bluegrass tradition with his group Punch Brothers and making daring explorations into the classical realm. This program is split: he’ll spend some of it accompanying himself in his own irresistible songs, and much of the rest performing selections from Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, several of which he has just recorded. (Zankel Hall. 212-247-7800. Oct. 22 at 7:30.)</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Yuja Wang </p><p class="no-indent">The dazzling young Chinese pianist makes her assault on Carnegie Hall, diving into works by Prokofiev, Chopin, Nikolai Kapustin, and Stravinsky (the formidable Three Movements from “Petrushka”). (212-247-7800. Oct. 22 at 8.)</p></div>
