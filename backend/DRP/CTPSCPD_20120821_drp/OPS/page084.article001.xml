<div class="article-body" id="Body"><p class="no-indent">Just minutes east of Savannah you’ll find Tybee Island. It’s a charming sun-and-fun coastal town offering as much or as little to do as your heart desires. And in the fall, just as most Southerners welcome the reprieve from the summer heat, Tybee’s locals and guests greet the season with renewed excitement and activities.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">What to Do </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Sightsee: Built in 1773, the Tybee Lighthouse is Georgia’s oldest and tallest. It’s worth the 178 steps to the top for a breathtaking view of the ocean and the island. Within walking distance, history buffs won’t want to miss the on-site museum and historic Fort Screven. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Go Shopping: Whether you’re looking for vintage treasures, handcrafted gifts and jewelry, or eclectic art, Tybee’s distinctive galleries, boutiques, and specialty stores are a shopper’s paradise. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Get Active: Surf fishing, deep-sea, and even freshwater fishing are easily accessible from the 3-mile-long island. Trout, bass, mackerel, snapper, and grouper are among the most abundant catches. And the area’s flat terrain makes biking and walking a pleasant way to get in some exercise while taking in the spectacular coastal views.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Where to Stay </p><br/><p class="no-indent">On Tybee Island, you’ll find oceanfront hotels, charming inns, bed-and-breakfasts, and even comfortable campgrounds. But if you’re looking for a getaway with all the comforts of home, the island’s many cottages are the way to go. Here are three standouts. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Old Love: Perfect for a mother-daughter retreat or a romantic escape, this cottage has 1920s charm with a tin roof, beadboard walls, and white picket fencing—along with every modern convenience. It’s within walking distance of restaurants and shopping and only 100 shorts steps down a quant path to the beach. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Breeze Inn: When lifelong girlfriends want to reconnect, this cottage is an ideal spot. The totally restored 2-story 1943 charmer is decorated from top to bottom with vintage antiques and treasures collected from estate sales by the cottage’s owner, author Mary Kay Andrews. It’s pet-friendly and features a fully stocked kitchen, comfortable living spaces, and shelves stacked with Andrew’s books, as well as other relaxing beach reads. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Inlet Breeze: For a multigenerational getaway, this one-level, restored Old Tybee boarding house will fit the needs of every age. Just a stroll from downtown, the beach, and restaurants, it features extra-large rooms, a wide front porch, spacious lawn, and screened-in porch, plus all the comforts and technologies of home. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">For more information on these and other Tybee Island cottages, visit mermaidcottages.com.</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Where to Eat </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Dining options on Tybee include seafood houses, dockside restaurants, and casual fine dining. Here are two that Paula personally recommends. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Tybee Social Club: This restaurant in the center of town is a whitewashed bungalow that’s fun, laid-back, and casual. The specialty of the house is a variety of upscale tacos filled with chargrilled seafood, succulent roasted meat, and vegetables all dressed with freshly made aiolis, salsas, and pestos. Locals and island visitors linger when the sun goes down for the live music and freshly muddled coastal cocktails. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Sundae Café: Named for the ice cream shop that previously occupied its location, the Sundae Café now offers casual fine dining in a menu inspired by classic Southern cooking. It’s not uncommon to see Paula and Michael there for an early dinner. And you can bet they’ll be having whatever comes with a side of the café’s famous Blue Cheese Bread Pudding.</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">Festival Fun</p><br/><p class="no-indent">For beach lovers who prefer cooler temperatures, Tybee Island hosts festivals and activities throughout the fourth quarter of the year. Events includes the Tybee Island Pirate Fest starting October 4, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Savannah Marathon and ½ Marathon on November 3, and Tybee for the Holidays from November 22 through January 1, which includes spectacular New Year’s Eve fireworks launched from the Tybee Pier at the stroke of midnight. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">8th Annual Tybee Island Pirate Fest October 4-7, 2012 </p><br/><p class="no-indent">Swashbucklers converge on Tybee Island to enjoy the Pirate Victory Parade, live entertainment, costume contests, and the Thieves Market that’s filled with treasures, grog, and grub. </p><br/><p class="no-indent">For more festival information or to plan a vacation on Tybee Island, visit tybeevisit.com.</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent"> FUN FACT! </p><br/><p class="no-indent">U.S. Highway 80 is 2,726 miles long from Tybee Island to San Diego.</p><br/><p>______________________________</p><br/><p class="no-indent">WEB EXTRAS</p><br/><p class="no-indent">For recipes from Sundae Café, including its famous Blue Cheese Bread Pudding, visit cookingwithpauladeen.com and click on Web Extras.</p></div>
