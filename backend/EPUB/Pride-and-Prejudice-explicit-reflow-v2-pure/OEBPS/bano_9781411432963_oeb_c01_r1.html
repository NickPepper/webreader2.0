<div class="tx1">It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;My dear Mr. Bennet,&#8221; said his lady to him one day, &#8220;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;But it is,&#8221; returned she; &#8220;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bennet made no answer.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Do not you want to know who has taken it?&#8221; cried his wife, impatiently.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">This was invitation enough.</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four<a id="Ref-FTN-1" href="bano_9781411432963_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1"><sup>a</sup></a> to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas,<a id="Ref-FTN-2" href="bano_9781411432963_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2"><sup>b</sup></a> and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;What is his name?&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Bingley.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Is he married or single?&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.<a id="Ref-en1" href="bano_9781411432963_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1"><sup>1</sup></a> What a fine thing for our girls!&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;How so? how can it affect them?&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;My dear Mr. Bennet,&#8221; replied his wife, &#8220;how can you be so tiresome? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Is that his design in settling here?&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <i>may</i> fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit him, if you do not.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the preference.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;They have none of them much to recommend them,&#8221; replied he: &#8220;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">&#8220;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.&#8221;</div>
<div class="tx">Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts,<a id="Ref-FTN-3" href="bano_9781411432963_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3"><sup>c</sup></a> sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</div>
