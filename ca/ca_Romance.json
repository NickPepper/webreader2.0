        "description": "chapter 4\nfor the third night in a row, sleep was a hard time coming. For the past months, Tuesday night was one of the three reserved for Casey. At any other time she would be in his bed.\nSheila rolled over to her back with a groan and stared up at the darkened ceiling morosely. What was he doing now? Was he alone in his bed or had he found someone else to share it with? Had she made a mistake? Had she let him go too quickly, before he could have realized she could mean something to him?\nWas she letting the past influence the present in such a way that she could be harming the hopes she had for her future? Of course she was, wasn\u2019t that what she was good at? She had already proved it.\nSeven years before, she hadn\u2019t demanded the commitment, or the words of love. She hadn\u2019t pressed the issue and she had learned the error of it. She\u2019d been used by the man she\u2019d thought she loved. Ross Mason had used her and her heart to get close to her father and to secure a military position that only Douglas Rutledge could assign.\n",

There was no way she would come out on the other end intact.\nShe always thought that at some point during the hours she spent in Nick Casey\u2019s bed, however, that something other than her orgasm would be found.\nEach time, she swore she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to be seduced, and each time he touched her, each time that sensual dominance swirled in his dark chocolate eyes, she found herself seduced. Seduced. Ready. Willing. He mesmerized her with his kiss and made her more than willing to beg for more. To plead.\nBreathless. Devoured. Fucked until she was screaming mindlessly in a pleasure so intense she was certain she would die from it. That was how she felt. And the pleasure became the center of her universe.\n\u201cOh God, Casey.\u201d She arched to him, her tone so rough and hoarse she didn\u2019t recognize it as her own.\nBut oh God, his touch was so good. Everything he did to her, every kiss, every stroke, every caress was ecstasy.\n",

He slid the bodice of her dress off her shoulders and down her arms, tugged the sleeves over her hands then draped the soft fabric across the dressing table. Then his warm lips touched the nape of her neck, and flutter-birds circled her stomach like dandelion puffs caught on a hard swirl of wind.\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he whispered, his breath soft and warm against her bare skin.\nShe felt a gentle tug in her hair, as he removed the spray of wildflowers she\u2019d worn.

The towel was now soaked, but he found he did not care. The air in the room was languorous and warm, thanks to the fire blazing in the grate. Neither of them risked being felled by pneumonia as a consequence of what he was about to do.\nBecause while the next sensible step might have been to cover up her wet body as quickly as possible, he wasn\u2019t feeling entirely sensible at the moment.\nHe carried her, soaking wet, to the bed and set about peeling the wet, transparent wrapper from her skin. The fabric stymied him at every turn, clinging to her shoulders, sticking to her arms. Slowly, slowly he tugged, until it bunched about her waist and the pale perfection of her breasts tipped into his greedy view.\nA word took a claw-hold in his mind. Mine.

Cold enough, actually, to send shivers down Faith\u2019s arms as she waved good-\u00adbye to the last guest, then walked from the barn to the lodge house. When she lit the fire in the hearth, the heat from the whoosh of flames felt good against her palms as she held them out in front of her.\nJust as she\u2019d hoped, the event tonight had gone smooth. Her organization had profited well, which meant she\u2019d have more funds to buy Christmas gifts for the kids and to open the doors to the ranch for several more children. Last summer, she\u2019d had an idea to turn custom-\u00adbuilt covered wagons and teepees into sleeping quarters for her young campers. The extra cash the silent and live auctions had brought in would go toward making that concept a reality.\nShe had Chase to thank for all the efforts he\u2019d put in behind the scenes. Even so, he\u2019d refused to let her publicly acknowledge his help. So many questions about him filtered through her mind. What were his plans? Where would he go and what would he do after he left the ranch?",

When she opened her eyes, she found him watching her.\nIn turn, her gaze lingered on his beautifully chiseled features.

        "description": "Valentina looked down to find Smith staring up at her, his eyes even darker than normal, and so intense that her heart skipped a beat in her chest.\nShe could see the desire on his face, knew hers matched it in equal measure, and yet past the desire was something that tore at her heart...a longing, a need she\u2019d worked so long and hard to hold at bay in herself. One that went far beyond making love.\nIt went to cold nights wrapped up together under a blanket on the couch.\nTo tears dried by someone you knew you could trust with your deepest, darkest secrets.\nTo afternoons on rocking chairs holding hands while grandchildren played at your feet.\nTenderness rose up in her just as swiftly as pleasure had and she pulled him back up over her to give him a kiss that was even sweeter than any that had come before. Just as sweet was the next warm rush of pleasure as his hands explored her naked skin from curve to curve while his tongue teased hers. She could taste herself on him and shivered at the incredibly potent memory of Smith between her legs, lapping at her as though she was the sweetest treat he\u2019d ever been given.\n",

On one hand he hoped Sierra had gone to bed, giving both of them a chance to cool off, think first before they did something impulsive. On the other hand, he wanted her awake, standing by the front door while holding out a glass of wine and a seductive come-hither expression on her face.\nShelby hadn\u2019t been happy about being dumped, not even a little. The first ten minutes of their date had consisted of him telling her why it wasn\u2019t ever going to work. The next hour had been torture listening to her rant about what a jerk he was.\nIf he hadn\u2019t been feeling so guilty about his ever-growing desire for Sierra he would\u2019ve never allowed Shelby to vent that long. He would\u2019ve coolly gotten to his feet and walked out the door. After an hour that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d done.\nShe was too embarrassed over public displays to chase him down and slap him in the middle of the restaurant, but he had a feeling she wasn\u2019t through. The look of utter disbelief in her eyes as he stood up had convinced him of that.\n",

She didn\u2019t advance into the chamber, but leaned back against the door as she continued to stare at him with an expression filled with nervousness equal to his own.\n",

Her skin felt seared, her limbs trembling, boneless.\nDeep inside, the very core of her being had gone molten, all of her thought and logic\u2014every last inhibition and fear\u2014obliterated by the shattering intensity of her release.\nAnd Nathan\u2019s scorching gaze promised even more.\nBreath racing short and shallow, Jordana lay back on the bed and watched, mesmerized, as he began to strip out of his combat boots and clothing in an economy of movement. Just the sight of his muscles bunching and flexing as he tore off his black patrol shirt and bared his arms and chest to her made more wet heat surge between her legs.\nDermaglyphs tracked all over his light olive-hued chest and shoulders, then lower, along the ridged planes of his abdomen and down below the waistband of his black fatigues. There could be no mistaking he was Gen One Breed. Jordana had seen precious few glyphs on other males, but nothing compared to the complicated pattern of interlocking swirls and elegant flourishes of Nathan\u2019s otherworldly skin markings.\n",

She had been known for her laughter almost as much as her fresh-cheeked beauty. Beautiful Moira. The woman he had loved . . . and lost.\nOccasionally, as he tore through the tunnels, Mac thought he could hear the sound of children. He knew without being told they were Lorcan and Moira\u2019s. He\u2019d never met them.\nGone. All gone.\nOverwhelming sadness settled upon him, and his only salvation was her voice.",

Jake was holding her, his arms curled protectively around her shoulders, with one of his hands splayed flat over her stomach beneath the T-shirt as if he were trying to protect more than just her.\nAnd he was completely naked.\nShe could feel the rigid flesh of his erection against the small of her back, the hairs on his thighs against the smooth skin of her legs, and as desire swiftly stole through her, she couldn\u2019t stop her half-asleep body from wanting to get even closer.\nShe\u2019d assumed night would be her enemy, those dark hours during the seven days she\u2019d promised.

Just to be near him like this, if only to know the sweetness of his touch for a few seconds, she\u2019d give up everything.\n",

The image of his housekeeper flooded her thoughts. No way. Besides she was married. And marriage seemed to mean a lot to the McClemores. Charmers all of them and heaven help the women in this town from Matt and his single brothers. Even his sister seemed hell bent. She\u2019d passed the local bar on her way to the ranch. The town was small but wouldn\u2019t you know they\u2019d have a large bar and dance club for the local ranches. He was probably the stud about Annona. Hadn\u2019t she already seen him in action? He could do a meet and greet in five and then sweet-talk his way into any woman\u2019s bed. Or heart. There had to be a line a mile long of breathless cowgirls wanting his attention.\n",

Right now, all she knew was that she couldn't stop rubbing her hands over his abs, over his pecs, over every square inch of his glorious broad, tanned chest. And that she'd die if she didn't kiss him that very second.\nShe'd never been so close to death before. His warmth, his heartbeat thudding against hers, the desire she read in his eyes\u2014they all meant life to her. Keeping her distance from Logan and staying safe in her little world suddenly meant nothing. Not when one malicious act had almost robbed her of her chance to feel joy, to feel anything at all. She wanted to sample life's sweetness and allow herself a taste of the pleasure she'd refused for so long.\nTheir mouths came together and it was a blur of heat and passion. No one was in charge. Instead, they were both taking something they desperately needed, something they could only find in each other's arms.\n",

When she\u2019d first arrived, she was dripping from head to foot all over the hard-packed clay floor.\nCalliope had been right on several accounts. The cottage was quite snug and clean as well. A single chair\u2014sturdy but old and flecked with aged red paint\u2014stood by a crescent-shaped fireplace recessed into the stone wall. A basket of firewood and kindling lay at the hearth with a cloth-wrapped bundle of tinder and flint. And a fringed blanket was draped over a peg on the wall.\nAs the spring rain turned into a storm outside, Delaney made herself more comfortable and started a fire. Yet even then, she couldn\u2019t remove the chill that covered her from head to toe. Her clothes were still dripping wet. She couldn\u2019t very well stand before the fire, expecting her clothes to dry quickly. They needed to be wrung out.\nShivering, she looked outside to the raging storm. Surely neither Bree nor Calliope would venture out in this.",

Inside her head, she was screaming, kiss him! Outside, she looked like she was playing a game of kiss freeze tag.\nMost likely picking up on her very convincing portrayal of a mannequin, Chase slowly pulled away, leaning back against his chair. His caramel-colored eyes searched hers. She\u2019d have loved for him to share his findings because Krista had no freaking idea what was going on with her.\nShe desperately wanted to laugh off her statue-like reaction and make some witty joke about her odd behavior, but it seemed her mouth had gone on strike from both the kissing and talking without telling her brain. No matter how hard she willed it, no words were coming out of her mouth. Actually, there was a very good possibility that her brain had actually joined her mouth on the picket line because she didn\u2019t think she could string a sentence together if her life had depended on it.\nSo they sat.",

Had resisted them ... until her.\nUntil now.\nUntil this moment, when he lifted her from her feet and carried her to the bed where she\u2019d slept for her entire life, and lay her down, following her down with his heady, heavy weight, pinning her beneath him with long limbs and corded strength and the promise of a pleasure she had never known.\nEight days prior, she\u2019d stood in his office and asked him to teach her about ruination; here, finally, was the lesson for which she had not known she\u2019d asked. The one for which she was utterly, completely desperate.\nHe kissed her, entirely different than the one that shattered her thought and breath earlier in the evening, but equally devastating. This one was slow and lavish, a claiming of lips and tongue that had her clinging to him, instantly addicted to the pleasure that only he could give.\nShe sighed her satisfaction, and he captured the sound with another long, lush mating of lips and tongues before lifting his head and meeting her gaze in the candlelight.",

That was number two on her fantasy list for when she lost her virginity.\nAfter listening to so many girls in high school and college talk about how utterly unremarkable their first times were, Ashley had vowed that her experience would be different. Perhaps she\u2019d been too picky as a result, but she\u2019d been determined to choose the right man and the right moment.

He was her warrior man, hard and strong. It was all too easy to imagine him on some battlefield, fighting for their country. Jack had always defended what was his.\nEven a temporary, summertime lover.\nWhile he effortlessly carried her up her stairs, she indulged in that little fantasy, drinking in the strength and the heat of him. She needed more of him, needed to touch those strong forearms, stroke the hard muscles beneath the faded cotton of his T-shirt. Each subtle brush of his skin against hers as he carried her to her bed set nerve endings on fire, had her sinking into sensual bliss. The darkened house was slowly filling with moonlight, starlight from her farm. As her eyes adjusted, the dense darkness outside faded, resolving into familiar shapes: the greenhouse and the rows of lavender plants. His now-familiar face looked down at her, watching her and not the steps he mastered so easily.",

Looking across at the clock on the dresser, he wasn\u2019t surprised\u2014it was almost two in the afternoon. After discovering Rebecca asleep the previous evening, he\u2019d gotten dressed and headed out, hiring a hackney to take him to Piccadilly. It had been close to three in the morning before he\u2019d returned home, but at least he\u2019d doubled his money at the gaming tables.\nStretching, he allowed himself a smile of contentment. Rebecca must think him a terrible card player after he\u2019d let her win yesterday. He wanted her to get a taste for the game though, and he knew that there was nothing more discouraging than constantly losing. Truth was that in spite of his uncle\u2019s complaints, he was one of the best gamblers he knew of. His biggest problem had been his love of spending\u2014parties, the phaeton, courtesans and jewels required to keep his mistresses exclusively to himself. It all seemed so ridiculous now in hindsight, but he\u2019d been a reckless fool back then without a care for the future.\n",

Her pleasure rocked him still, mingling with his own, drugging him and making it hard to control his incubus nature. He pressed his teeth to her soft flesh, feeling it quivering and her pulse beating hard against his lips, trying to rouse his more dominant vampire nature in order to suppress his other side. His fangs didn\u2019t lengthen but his incubus instincts did recede a fraction. It was always hard to suppress his incubus urges with his vampire desires even at the easiest times, like when he was at Vampirerotique and the shows were taking place. Now, it was verging on impossible. His incubus hungers pushed him to keep going, to lick and tease her to a second orgasm so he could feel that intense rush of pleasure flow through him. It forced his vampire side to recede.\nHe knew that he needed to embrace the incubus part of himself, just as Elissa had said, but he was afraid of what might happen if he did.\n",

It was much too cold in this fashionable quarter surrounding Grosvenor Square for itinerate sellers, thieves, pickpockets, and drunken Merry-Andrews who usually roamed the streets at this late hour. Even the chairmen were scarce. But then a carriage pulled up outside a particular townhouse in South Audley Street, and out stepped a lady in a fur-lined hooded cape, wearing pattens to keep the muck off her satin slippers.\nShe had just come from Drury Lane Theatre, where she had enjoyed the attentions of her son\u2019s circle of male friends and the admiration of one or two gentlemen nearer her own age, who left their cards and asked permission to call on her the following day. She had no idea what the play was about or the names of its actors, but she had spent the evening surrounded by titled and wealthy males. She was more than satisfied with her foray to the theater.\n",
